<h2>I.</h2>

<h3>A STARTLING COINCIDENCE.</h3>

<div class='poem'>
By the pricking of my thumbs,<br />
Something wicked this way comes.<br />
<div class='sig'>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Macbeth.</span></div><br />
</div>


<div class='cap'>THE town clock of Sibley had just struck twelve.
Court had adjourned, and Judge Evans, with
one or two of the leading lawyers of the county, stood
in the door-way of the court-house discussing in a
friendly way the eccentricities of criminals as developed
in the case then before the court. Mr. Lord had just
ventured the assertion that crime as a fine art was
happily confined to France; to which District Attorney
Ferris had replied:</div>

<p>"And why? Because atheism has not yet acquired
such a hold upon our upper classes that gentlemen
think it possible to meddle with such matters. It is
only when a student, a doctor, a lawyer, determines
to put aside from his path the secret stumbling-block<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
to his desires or his ambition that the true intellectual
crime is developed. That brute whom you see slouching
along over the way is the type of the average
criminal of the day."</p>

<p>And he indicated with a nod a sturdy, ill-favored man,
who, with pack on his back, was just emerging from
a grassy lane that opened out from the street directly
opposite the court-house.</p>

<p>"Such men are often seen in the dock," remarked
Mr. Orcutt, of more than local reputation as a criminal
lawyer. "And often escape the penalty of their crimes,"
he added, watching, with a curious glance, the lowering
brow and furtive look of the man who, upon perceiving
the attention he had attracted, increased his pace till he
almost broke into a run.</p>

<p>"Looks as if he had been up to mischief," observed
Judge Evans.</p>

<p>"Rather as if he had heard the sentence which was
passed upon the last tramp who paid his respects to
this town," corrected Mr. Lord.</p>

<p>"Revenons &agrave; nos moutons," resumed the District Attorney.
"Crime, as an investment, does not pay in this
country. The regular burglar leads a dog's life of it;
and when you come to the murderer, how few escape
suspicion if they do the gallows. I do not know of a case
where a murder for money has been really successful in
this region."</p>

<p>"Then you must have some pretty cute detective work<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
going on here," remarked a young man who had not before
spoken.</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;nothing to brag of. But the brutes are so
clumsy&mdash;that is the word, clumsy. They don't know how
to cover up their tracks."</p>

<p>"The smart ones don't make tracks," interposed a
rough voice near them, and a large, red-haired, slightly
hump-backed man, who, from the looks of those about,
was evidently a stranger in the place, shuffled forward
from the pillar against which he had been leaning, and
took up the thread of conversation.</p>

<p>"I tell you," he continued, in a gruff tone somewhat
out of keeping with the studied abstraction of his keen,
gray eye, "that half the criminals are caught because they
do make tracks and then resort to such extraordinary
means to cover them up. The true secret of success in
this line lies in striking your blow with a weapon picked
up on the spot, and in choosing for the scene of your tragedy
a thoroughfare where, in the natural course of events,
other men will come and go and unconsciously tread out
your traces, provided you have made any. This dissipates
suspicion, or starts it in so many directions that
justice is at once confused, if not ultimately baffled.
Look at that house yonder," the stranger pursued, pointing
to a plain dwelling on the opposite corner. "While
we have been standing here, several persons of one kind
or another, and among them a pretty rough-looking tramp,
have gone into the side gate and so around to the kitchen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
door and back. I don't know who lives there, but say it
is a solitary old woman above keeping help, and that an
hour from now some one, not finding her in the house,
searches through the garden and comes upon her lying
dead behind the wood-pile, struck down by her own axe.
On whom are you going to lay your hand in suspicion?
On the stranger, of course&mdash;the rough-looking tramp
that everybody thinks is ready for bloodshed at the
least provocation. But suspicion is not conviction, and I
would dare wager that no court, in face of a persistent
denial on his part that he even saw the old woman when
he went to her door, would bring in a verdict of murder
against him, even though silver from her private drawer
were found concealed upon his person. The chance that he
spoke the truth, and that she was not in the house when he
entered, and that his crime had been merely one of burglary
or theft, would be enough to save him from the
hangman."</p>

<p>"That is true," assented Mr. Lord, "unless all the
other persons who had been seen to go into the yard were
not only reputable men, but were willing to testify to having
seen the woman alive up to the time he invaded her
premises."</p>

<p>But the hump-backed stranger had already lounged
away.</p>

<p>"What do you think about this, Mr. Byrd?" inquired
the District Attorney, turning to the young man before alluded
to. "You are an expert in these matters, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
ought to be. What would you give for the tramp's
chances if the detectives took him in hand?"</p>

<p>"I, sir?" was the response. "I am so comparatively
young and inexperienced in such affairs, that I scarcely
dare presume to express an opinion. But I have heard
it said by Mr. Gryce, who you know stands foremost
among the detectives of New York, that the only case of
murder in which he utterly failed to get any clue to work
upon, was that of a Jew who was knocked down in his
own shop in broad daylight. But this will not appear so
strange when you learn the full particulars. The store
was situated between two alley-ways in Harlem. It had
an entrance back and an entrance front. Both were in
constant use. The man was found behind his counter,
having evidently been hit on the head by a slung-shot
while reaching for a box of hosiery. But though a succession
of people were constantly passing by both doors,
there was for that very reason no one to tell which of all
the men who were observed to enter the shop, came out
again with blood upon his conscience. Nor were the circumstances
of the Jew's life such as to assist justice. The
most careful investigation failed to disclose the existence
of any enemy, nor was he found to possess in this country,
at least, any relative who could have hoped to be
benefited by the few dollars he had saved from a late
bankruptcy. The only conclusion to be drawn is that the
man was secretly in the way of some one and was as
secretly put out of it, but for what purpose or by whose
hand, time has never disclosed."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is one, however, who knows both," affirmed
Judge Evans, impressively.</p>

<p>"The man himself?"</p>

<p>"God!"</p>

<p>The solemnity with which this was uttered caused a
silence, during which Mr. Orcutt looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"I must go to dinner," he announced, withdrawing,
with a slight nod, across the street.</p>

<p>The rest stood for a few minutes abstractedly contemplating
his retreating figure, as with an energetic pace all
his own he passed down the little street that opened opposite
to where they stood, and entered the unpretending
cottage of a widow lady, with whom he was in the habit
of taking his mid-day meal whenever he had a case before
the court.</p>

<p>A lull was over the whole village, and the few remaining
persons on the court-house steps were about to separate,
when Mr. Lord uttered an exclamation and pointed
to the cottage into which they had just seen Mr. Orcutt
disappear. Immediately all eyes looked that way and
saw the lawyer standing on the stoop, having evidently
issued with the utmost precipitation from the house.</p>

<p>"He is making signs," cried Mr. Lord to Mr. Ferris;
and scarcely knowing what they feared, both gentlemen
crossed the way and hurried down the street toward
their friend, who, with unusual tokens of disturbance in
his manner, ran forward to meet them.</p>

<p>"A murder!" he excitedly exclaimed, as soon as he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
came within speaking distance. "A strange and startling
coincidence. Mrs. Clemmens has been struck on the
head, and is lying covered with blood at the foot of her
dining-room table."</p>

<p>Mr. Lord and the District Attorney stared at each
other in a maze of surprise and horror easily to be comprehended,
and then they rushed forward.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment," the latter suddenly cried, stopping
short and looking back. "Where is the fellow who talked
so learnedly about murder and the best way of making a
success of it. He must be found at once. I don't believe
in coincidences." And he beckoned to the person
they had called Byrd, who with very pardonable curiosity
was hurrying their way. "Go find Hunt, the constable,"
he cried; "tell him to stop and retain the humpback.
A woman here has been found murdered, and that fellow
must have known something about it."</p>

<p>The young man stared, flushed with sudden intelligence,
and darted off. Mr. Ferris turned, found Mr.
Orcutt still at his side, and drew him forward to rejoin
Mr. Lord, who by this time was at the door of the
cottage.</p>

<p>They all went in together, Mr. Ferris, who was of an
adventurous disposition, leading the way. The room
into which they first stepped was empty. It was evidently
the widow's sitting-room, and was in perfect order, with
the exception of Mr. Orcutt's hat, which lay on the centre-table
where he had laid it on entering. Neat, without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
being prim, the entire aspect of the place was one of
comfort, ease, and modest luxury. For, though the
Widow Clemmens lived alone and without help, she was
by no means an indigent person, as a single glance at her
house would show. The door leading into the farther
room was open, and toward this they hastened, led by
the glitter of the fine old china service which loaded the
dining-table.</p>

<p>"She is there," said Mr. Orcutt, pointing to the other
side of the room.</p>

<p>They immediately passed behind the table, and there,
sure enough, lay the prostrate figure of the widow, her
head bleeding, her arms extended, one hand grasping her
watch, which she had loosened from her belt, the other
stretched toward a stick of firewood, that, from the mark
of blood upon its side, had evidently been used to fell
her to the floor. She was motionless as stone, and was,
to all appearance, dead.</p>

<p>"Sickening, sickening!&mdash;horrible!" exclaimed Mr.
Lord, recoiling upon the District Attorney with a gesture,
as if he would put the frightful object out of his sight.
"What motive could any one have for killing such an inoffensive
woman? The deviltry of man is beyond
belief!"</p>

<p>"And after what we have heard, inexplicable," asserted
Mr. Ferris. "To be told of a supposable case of murder
one minute, and then to see it exemplified in this dreadful
way the next, is an experience of no common order.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
I own I am overcome by it." And he flung open a door
that communicated with the lane and let the outside air
sweep in.</p>

<p>"That door was unlocked," remarked Mr. Lord,
glancing at Mr. Orcutt, who stood with severe, set face,
looking down at the outstretched form which, for several
years now, had so often sat opposite to him at his noonday
meal.</p>

<p>With a start the latter looked up. "What did you say?
The door unlocked? There is nothing strange in that.
She never locked her doors, though she was so very deaf
I often advised her to." And he allowed his eyes to run
over the wide stretch of low, uncultivated ground before
him, that, in the opinion of many persons, was such a decided
blot upon the town. "There is no one in sight," he
reluctantly admitted.</p>

<p>"No," responded the other. "The ground is unfavorable
for escape. It is marshy and covered with snake
grass. A man could make his way, however, between
the hillocks into those woods yonder, if he were driven by
fear or understood the path well. What is the matter,
Orcutt?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," affirmed the latter,&mdash;"nothing, I thought I
heard a groan."</p>

<p>"You heard me make an exclamation," spoke up Mr.
Ferris, who by this time had sufficiently overcome his
emotion to lift the head of the prostrate woman and look
in her face. "This woman is not dead."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>"What!" they both cried, bounding forward.</p>

<p>"See, she breathes," continued the former, pointing to
her slowly laboring chest. "The villain, whoever he was,
did not do his work well; she may be able to tell us something
yet."</p>

<p>"I do not think so," murmured Mr. Orcutt. "Such a
blow as that must have destroyed her faculties, if not her
life. It was of cruel force."</p>

<p>"However that may be, she ought to be taken care
of now," cried Mr. Ferris. "I wish Dr. Tredwell was
here."</p>

<p>"I will go for him," signified the other.</p>

<p>But it was not necessary. Scarcely had the lawyer
turned to execute this mission, when a sudden murmur
was heard at the door, and a dozen or so citizens burst
into the house, among them the very person named.
Being coroner as well as physician, he at once assumed
authority. The widow was carried into her room, which
was on the same floor, and a brother practitioner sent for,
who took his place at her head and waited for any sign of
returning consciousness. The crowd, remanded to the
yard, spent their time alternately in furtive questionings
of each other's countenances, and in eager look-out for
the expected return of the strange young man who had
been sent after the incomprehensible humpback of
whom all had heard. The coroner, closeted with the
District Attorney in the dining-room, busied himself in
noting certain evident facts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am, perhaps, forestalling my duties in interfering
before the woman is dead," intimated the former. "But
it is only a matter of a few hours, and any facts we can
glean in the interim must be of value to a proper conduct
of the inquiry I shall be called upon to hold. I
shall therefore make the same note of the position of affairs
as I would do if she were dead; and to begin with,
I wish you to observe that she was hit while setting the
clock." And he pointed to the open door of the huge
old-fashioned timepiece which occupied that corner of
the room in which she had been found. "She had not
even finished her task," he next remarked, "for the
clock is still ten minutes slow, while her watch is just
right, as you will see by comparing it with your own.
She was attacked from behind, and to all appearances unexpectedly.
Had she turned, her forehead would have
been struck, while, as all can see, it is the back of her head
that has suffered, and that from a right-hand blow.
Her deafness was undoubtedly the cause of her immobility
under the approach of such an assailant. She
did not hear his step, and, being so busily engaged, saw
nothing of the cruel hand uplifted to destroy her. I
doubt if she even knew what happened. The mystery is
that any one could have sufficiently desired her death to
engage in such a cold-blooded butchery. If plunder
were wanted, why was not her watch taken from her?
And see, here is a pile of small change lying beside her
plate on the table,&mdash;a thing a tramp would make for at
once."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was not a thief that struck her."</p>

<p>"Well, well, we don't know. I have my own theory,"
admitted the coroner; "but, of course, it will not do for
me to mention it here. The stick was taken from that
pile laid ready on the hearth," he went on. "Odd, significantly
odd, that in all its essential details this affair
should tally so completely with the supposable case of
crime given a moment before by the deformed wretch
you tell me about."</p>

<p>"Not if that man was a madman and the assailant,"
suggested the District Attorney.</p>

<p>"True, but I do not think he was mad&mdash;not from what
you have told me. But let us see what the commotion is.
Some one has evidently arrived."</p>

<p>It was Mr. Byrd, who had entered by the front door,
and deaf to the low murmur of the impatient crowd
without, stood waiting in silent patience for an opportunity
to report to the District Attorney the results of his
efforts.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris at once welcomed him.</p>

<p>"What have you done? Did you find the constable
or succeed in laying hands on that scamp of a humpback?"</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd, who, to explain at once, was a young and
intelligent detective, who had been brought from New
York for purposes connected with the case then before
the court, glanced carefully in the direction of the coroner
and quietly replied:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>"The hump-backed scamp, as you call him, has disappeared.
Whether he will be found or not I cannot
say. Hunt is on his track, and will report to you
in an hour. The tramp whom you saw slinking out
of this street while we stood on the court-house steps
is doubtless the man whom you most want, and him
we have captured."</p>

<p>"You have?" repeated Mr. Ferris, eying, with good-natured
irony, the young man's gentlemanly but rather
indifferent face. "And what makes you think it is the
tramp who is the guilty one in this case? Because that
ingenious stranger saw fit to make him such a prominent
figure in his suppositions?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied the detective, flushing with a momentary
embarrassment he however speedily overcame;
"I do not found my opinions upon any man's remarks.
I only&mdash;&mdash; Excuse me," said he, with a quiet air of self-control
that was not without its effect upon the sensible
man he was addressing. "If you will tell me how, where,
and under what circumstances this poor murdered woman
was found, perhaps I shall be better able to explain my
reasons for believing in the tramp as the guilty party;
though the belief, even of a detective, goes for but little
in matters of this kind, as you and these other gentlemen
very well know."</p>

<p>"Step here, then," signified Mr. Ferris, who, accompanied
by the coroner, had already passed around the
table. "Do you see that clock? She was winding it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
when she was struck, and fell almost at its foot. The
weapon which did the execution lies over there; it is a
stick of firewood, as you see, and was caught up from
that pile on the hearth. Now recall what that humpback
said about choosing a thoroughfare for a murder (and
this house is a thoroughfare), and the peculiar stress
which he laid upon the choice of a weapon, and tell me
why you think he is innocent of this immediate and most
remarkable exemplification of his revolting theory?"</p>

<p>"Let me first ask," ventured the other, with a remaining
tinge of embarrassment coloring his cheek, "if you
have reason to think this woman had been lying long
where she was found, or was she struck soon before the
discovery?"</p>

<p>"Soon. The dinner was still smoking in the kitchen,
where it had been dished up ready for serving."</p>

<p>"Then," declared the detective with sudden confidence,
"a single word will satisfy you that the humpback
was not the man who delivered this stroke. To lay that
woman low at the foot of this clock would require the
presence of the assailant in the room. Now, the humpback
was not here this morning, but in the court-room. I
know this, for I saw him there."</p>

<p>"You did? You are sure of that?" cried, in a breath,
both his hearers, somewhat taken aback by this revelation.</p>

<p>"Yes. He sat down by the door. I noticed him particularly."</p>

<p>"Humph! that is odd," quoth Mr. Ferris, with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
testiness of an irritable man who sees himself contradicted
in a publicly expressed theory.</p>

<p>"Very odd," repeated the coroner; "so odd, I am
inclined to think he did not sit there every moment of
the time. It is but a step from the court-house here; he
might well have taken the trip and returned while you
wiped your eye-glasses or was otherwise engaged."</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd did not see fit to answer this.</p>

<p>"The tramp is an ugly-looking customer," he remarked,
in what was almost a careless tone of voice.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris covered with his hand the pile of loose
change that was yet lying on the table, and shortly observed:</p>

<p>"A tramp to commit such a crime must be actuated
either by rage or cupidity; that you will acknowledge.
Now the fellow who struck this woman could not have
been excited by any sudden anger, for the whole position
of her body when found proves that she had not even
turned to face the intruder, much less engaged in an
altercation with him. Yet how could it have been money
he was after, when a tempting bit like this remained undisturbed
upon the table?"</p>

<p>And Mr. Ferris, with a sudden gesture, disclosed to
view the pile of silver coin he had been concealing.</p>

<p>The young detective shook his head but lost none of
his seeming indifference. "That is one of the little
anomalies of criminal experience that we were talking
about this morning," he remarked. "Perhaps the fellow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
was frightened and lost his head, or perhaps he really
heard some one at the door, and was obliged to escape
without reaping any of the fruits of his crime."</p>

<p>"Perhaps and perhaps," retorted Mr. Ferris, who was
a quick man, and who, once settled in a belief, was not to
be easily shaken out of it.</p>

<p>"However that may be," continued Mr. Byrd, without
seeming to notice the irritating interruption, "I still think
that the tramp, rather than the humpback, will be the
man to occupy your future attention."</p>

<p>And with a deprecatory bow to both gentlemen, he
drew back and quietly left the room.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris at once recovered from his momentary loss
of temper.</p>

<p>"I suppose the young man is right," he acknowledged;
"but, if so, what an encouragement we have received this
morning to a belief in clairvoyance." And with less
irony and more conviction, he added: "The humpback
<i>must</i> have known something about the murder."</p>

<p>And the coroner bowed; common-sense undoubtedly
agreeing with this assumption.</p>

<h2>II.</h2>

<h3>AN APPEAL TO HEAVEN.</h3>

<div class='center'>
Her step was royal&mdash;queen-like.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Longfellow.</span><br />
<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>IT was now half-past one. An hour and a half had
elapsed since the widow had been laid upon her bed,
and to all appearance no change had taken place in her
condition. Within the room where she lay were collected
the doctor and one or two neighbors of the female sex,
who watched every breath she drew, and stood ready to
notice the slightest change in the stony face that, dim with
the shadow of death, stared upon them from the unruffled
pillows. In the sitting-room Lawyer Orcutt conversed
in a subdued voice with Mr. Ferris, in regard to
such incidents of the widow's life as had come under his
notice in the years of their daily companionship, while
the crowd about the gate vented their interest in loud exclamations
of wrath against the tramp who had been
found, and the unknown humpback who had not. Our
story leads us into the crowd in front.</div>

<p>"I don't think she'll ever come to," said one, who
from his dusty coat might have been a miller. "Blows
like that <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'have'nt'">haven't</ins> much let-up about them."</p>

<p>"Doctor says she will die before morning," put in a
pert young miss, anxious to have her voice heard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then it will be murder and no mistake, and that
brute of a tramp will hang as high as Haman."</p>

<p>"Don't condemn a man before you've had a chance to
hear what he has to say for himself," cried another in a
strictly judicial tone. "How do you know as he came to
this house at all?"</p>

<p>"Miss Perkins says he did, and Mrs. Phillips too; they
saw him go into the gate."</p>

<p>"And what else did they see? I warrant he wasn't the
only beggar that was roaming round this morning."</p>

<p>"No; there was a tin peddler in the street, for I saw
him my own self, and Mrs. Clemmens standing in the
door flourishing her broom at him. She was mighty short
with such folks. Wouldn't wonder if some of the unholy
wretches killed her out of spite. They're a wicked lot,
the whole of them."</p>

<p>"Widow Clemmens had a quick temper, but she had a
mighty good heart notwithstanding. See how kind she
was to them Hubbells."</p>

<p>"And how hard she was to that Pratt girl."</p>

<p>"Well, I know, but&mdash;&mdash;" And so on and so on, in a
hum and a buzz about the head of Mr. Byrd, who, engaged
in thought seemingly far removed from the subject
in hand, stood leaning against the fence, careless and <i>insouciant</i>.
Suddenly there was a lull, then a short cry,
then a woman's voice rose clear, ringing, and commanding,
and Mr. Byrd caught the following words:</p>

<p>"What is this I hear? Mrs. Clemmens dead? Struck<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
down by some wandering tramp? Murdered and in her
own house?"</p>

<p>In an instant, every eye, including Mr. Byrd's, was
fixed upon the speaker. The crowd parted, and the
young girl, who had spoken from the street, came into
the gate. She was a remarkable-looking person. Tall,
large, and majestic in every proportion of an unusually
noble figure, she was of a make and possessed a bearing
to attract attention had she borne a less striking and
beautiful countenance. As it was, the glance lingered
but a moment on the grand curves and lithe loveliness of
that matchless figure, and passed at once to the face.
Once there, it did not soon wander; for though its beauty
was incontestable, the something that lay behind that
beauty was more incontestable still, and held you, in spite
of yourself, long after you had become acquainted with
the broad white brow, the clear, deep, changing gray eye,
the straight but characteristic nose, and the ruddy, nervous
lip. You felt that, young and beautiful as she was,
and charming as she might be, she was also one of
nature's unsolvable mysteries&mdash;a woman whom you might
study, obey, adore, but whom you could never hope to
understand; a Sphinx without an &OElig;dipus. She was
dressed in dark green, and held her gloves in her hand.
Her appearance was that of one who had been profoundly
startled.</p>

<p>"Why don't some one answer me?" she asked, after
an instant's pause, seemingly unconscious that, alike to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
those who knew her and to those who did not, her air and
manner were such as to naturally impose silence. "Must
I go into the house in order to find out if this good
woman is dead or not?"</p>

<p>"Shure she isn't dead yet," spoke up a brawny butcher-boy,
bolder than the rest. "But she's sore hurt, miss,
and the doctors say as how there is no hope."</p>

<p>A change impossible to understand passed over the
girl's face. Had she been less vigorous of body, she
would have staggered. As it was, she stood still, rigidly
still, and seemed to summon up her faculties, till the very
clinch of her fingers spoke of the strong control she was
putting upon herself.</p>

<p>"It is dreadful, dreadful!" she murmured, this time
in a whisper, and as if to some rising protest in her own
soul. "No good can come of it, none." Then, as if
awakening to the scene about her, shook her head and
cried to those nearest: "It was a tramp who did it, I
suppose; at least, I am told so."</p>

<p>"A tramp has been took up, miss, on suspicion, as they
call it."</p>

<p>"If a tramp has been taken up on suspicion, then he
was the one who assailed her, of course." And pushing
on through the crowd that fell back still more awe-struck
than before, she went into the house.</p>

<p>The murmur that followed her was subdued but universal.
It made no impression on Mr. Byrd. He had
leaned forward to watch the girl's retreating form, but,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
finding his view intercepted by the wrinkled profile of
an old crone who had leaned forward too, had drawn
impatiently back. Something in that crone's aged face
made him address her.</p>

<p>"You know the lady?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the cautious reply, given, however, with a
leer he found not altogether pleasant.</p>

<p>"She is a relative of the injured woman, or a friend,
perhaps?"</p>

<p>The old woman's face looked frightful.</p>

<p>"No," she muttered grimly; "they are strangers."</p>

<p>At this unexpected response Mr. Byrd made a perceptible
start forward. The old woman's hand fell at
once on his arm.</p>

<p>"Stay!" she hoarsely whispered. "By strangers I
mean they don't visit each other. The town is too small
for any of us to be strangers."</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd nodded and escaped her clutch.</p>

<p>"This is worth seeing through," he murmured, with
the first gleam of interest he had shown in the affair.
And, hurrying forward, he succeeded in following the
lady into the house.</p>

<p>The sight he met there did not tend to allay his newborn
interest. There she stood in the centre of the sitting-room,
tall, resolute, and commanding, her eyes fixed
on the door of the room that contained the still breathing
sufferer, Mr. Orcutt's eyes fixed upon her. It seemed
as if she had asked one question and been answered;
there had not been time for more.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do not know what to say in apology for my intrusion,"
she remarked. "But the death, or almost the
death, of a person of whom we have all heard, seems to
me so terrible that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But here Mr. Orcutt interrupted gently, almost tenderly,
but with a fatherly authority which Mr. Byrd expected
to see her respect.</p>

<p>"Imogene," he observed, "this is no place for you;
the horror of the event has made you forget yourself; go
home and trust me to tell you on my return all that it is
advisable for you to know."</p>

<p>But she did not even meet his glance with her steady
eyes. "Thank you," she protested; "but I cannot go
till I have seen the place where this woman fell and the
weapon with which she was struck. I want to see it all.
Mr. Ferris, will you show me?" And without giving
any reason for this extraordinary request, she stood waiting
with that air of conscious authority which is sometimes
given by great beauty when united to a distinguished
personal presence.</p>

<p>The District Attorney, taken aback, moved toward the
dining-room door. "I will consult with the coroner,"
said he.</p>

<p>But she waited for no man's leave. Following close
behind him, she entered upon the scene of the tragedy.</p>

<p>"Where was the poor woman hit?" she inquired.</p>

<p>They told her; they showed her all she desired and
asked her no questions. She awed them, all but Mr.
Orcutt&mdash;him she both astonished and alarmed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"And a tramp did all this?" she finally exclaimed, in
the odd, musing tone she had used once before, while her
eye fell thoughtfully to the floor. Suddenly she started,
or so Mr. Byrd fondly imagined, and moved a pace, setting
her foot carefully down upon a certain spot in the
carpet beneath her.</p>

<p>"She has spied something," he thought, and watched
to see if she would stoop.</p>

<p>But no, she held herself still more erectly than before,
and seemed, by her rather desultory inquiries, to be
striving to engage the attention of the others from herself.</p>

<p>"There is some one surely tapping at this door," she
intimated, pointing to the one that opened into the lane.</p>

<p>Dr. Tredwell moved to see.</p>

<p>"Is there not?" she repeated, glancing at Mr. Ferris.</p>

<p>He, too, turned to see.</p>

<p>But there was still an eye regarding her from behind
the sitting-room door, and, perceiving it, she impatiently
ceased her efforts. She was not mistaken about the
tapping. A man was at the door whom both gentlemen
seemed to know.</p>

<p>"I come from the tavern where they are holding this
tramp in custody," announced the new-comer in a voice
too low to penetrate into the room. "He is frightened
almost out of his wits. Seems to think he was taken up
for theft, and makes no bones of saying that he did take
a spoon or two from a house where he was let in for a
bite. He gave up the spoons and expects to go to jail,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
but seems to have no idea that any worse suspicion is
hanging over him. Those that stand around think he is
innocent of the murder."</p>

<p>"Humph! well, we will see," ejaculated Mr. Ferris;
and, turning back, he met, with a certain sort of complacence,
the eyes of the young lady who had been somewhat
impatiently awaiting his reappearance. "It seems
there are doubts, after all, about the tramp being the
assailant."</p>

<p>The start she gave was sudden and involuntary. She
took a step forward and then paused as if hesitating.
Instantly, Mr. Byrd, who had not forgotten the small
object she had been covering with her foot, sauntered
leisurely forward, and, spying a ring on the floor where
she had been standing, unconcernedly picked it up.</p>

<p>She did not seem to notice him. Looking at Mr.
Ferris with eyes whose startled, if not alarmed, expression
she did not succeed in hiding from the detective, she
inquired, in a stifled voice:</p>

<p>"What do you mean? What has this man been telling
you? You say it was not the tramp. Who, then, was it?"</p>

<p>"That is a question we cannot answer," rejoined Mr.
Ferris, astonished at her heat, while Lawyer Orcutt,
moving forward, attempted once more to recall her to
herself.</p>

<p>"Imogene," he pleaded,&mdash;"Imogene, calm yourself.
This is not a matter of so much importance to you that
you need agitate yourself so violently in regard to it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Come home, I beseech you, and leave the affairs of justice
to the attention of those whose duty it is to look after
them."</p>

<p>But beyond acknowledging his well-meant interference
by a deprecatory glance, she stood immovable, looking
from Dr. Tredwell to Mr. Ferris, and back again to Dr.
Tredwell, as if she sought in their faces some confirmation
of a hideous doubt or fear that had arisen in her own
mind. Suddenly she felt a touch on her arm.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, madam, but is this yours?" inquired a
smooth and careless voice over her shoulder.</p>

<p>As though awakening from a dream she turned; they
all turned. Mr. Byrd was holding out in his open palm
a ring blazing with a diamond of no mean lustre or
value.</p>

<p>The sight of such a jewel, presented at such a moment,
completed the astonishment of her friends. Pressing
forward, they stared at the costly ornament and then at
her, Mr. Orcutt's face especially assuming a startled
expression of mingled surprise and apprehension, that
soon attracted the attention of the others, and led to an
interchange of looks that denoted a mutual but not
unpleasant understanding.</p>

<p>"I found it at your feet," explained the detective, still
carelessly, but with just that delicate shade of respect in
his voice necessary to express a gentleman's sense of presumption
in thus addressing a strange and beautiful young
lady.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>The tone, if not the explanation, seemed to calm her,
as powerful natures are calmed in the stress of a sudden
crisis.</p>

<p>"Thank you," she returned, not without signs of great
sweetness in her look and manner. "Yes, it is mine," she
added slowly, reaching out her hand and taking the ring.
"I must have dropped it without knowing it." And
meeting the eye of Mr. Orcutt fixed upon her with that
startled look of inquiry already alluded to, she flushed, but
placed the jewel nonchalantly on her finger.</p>

<p>This cool appropriation of something he had no reason
to believe hers, startled the youthful detective immeasurably.
He had not expected such a <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> to the little
drama he had prepared with such quiet assurance, and,
though with the quick self-control that distinguished him
he forbore to show his surprise, he none the less felt baffled
and ill at ease, all the more that the two gentlemen
present, who appeared to be the most disinterested in
their regard for this young lady, seemed to accept this
act on her part as genuine, and therefore not to be questioned.</p>

<p>"It is a clue that is lost," thought he. "I have made
a mess of my first unassisted efforts at real detective
work." And, inwardly disgusted with himself, he drew
back into the other room and took up his stand at a remote
window.</p>

<p>The slight stir he made in crossing the room seemed to
break a spell and restore the minds of all present to their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
proper balance. Mr. Orcutt threw off the shadow that
had momentarily disturbed his quiet and assured mien,
and advancing once more, held out his arm with even
more kindness than before, saying impressively:</p>

<p>"Now you will surely consent to accompany me
home. You cannot mean to remain here any longer, can
you, Imogene?"</p>

<p>But before she could reply, before her hand could lay
itself on his arm, a sudden hush like that of awe passed
solemnly through the room, and the physician, who had
been set to watch over the dying gasps of the poor sufferer
within, appeared on the threshold of the bedroom
door, holding up his hand with a look that at once commanded
attention and awoke the most painful expectancy
in the hearts of all who beheld him:</p>

<p>"She stirs; she moves her lips," he announced, and
again paused, listening.</p>

<p>Immediately there was a sound from the dimness behind
him, a low sound, inarticulate at first, but presently
growing loud enough and plain enough to be heard in the
utmost recesses of the furthermost room on that floor.</p>

<p>"Hand! ring!" was the burden of the short ejaculation
they heard. "Ring! hand!" till a sudden gasp cut
short the fearful iteration, and all was silent again.</p>

<p>"Great heavens!" came in an awe-struck whisper from
Mr. Ferris, as he pressed hastily toward the place from
which these words had issued.</p>

<p>But the physician at once stopped and silenced him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"She may speak again," he suggested. "Wait."</p>

<p>But, though they listened breathlessly, and with ever-growing
suspense, no further break occurred in the deep
silence, and soon the doctor announced:</p>

<p>"She has sunk back into her old state; she may rouse
again, and she may not."</p>

<p>As though released from some painful tension, the
coroner, the District Attorney, and the detective all
looked up. They found Miss Dare standing by the open
window, with her face turned to the landscape, and Mr.
Orcutt gazing at her with an expression of perplexity that
had almost the appearance of dismay. This look passed
instantly from the lawyer's countenance as he met the
eyes of his friends, but Mr. Byrd, who was still smarting
under a sense of his late defeat, could not but wonder
what that gentleman had seen in Miss Dare, during the
period of their late preoccupation, to call up such an expression
to his usually keen and composed face.</p>

<p>The clinch of her white hand on the window-sill told
nothing; but when in a few moments later she turned
toward them again, Mr. Byrd saw, or thought he saw, the
last lingering remains of a great horror fading out of her
eyes, and was not surprised when she walked up to Mr.
Orcutt and said, somewhat hoarsely: "I wish to go home
now. This place is a terrible one to be in."</p>

<p>Mr. Orcutt, who was only too glad to comply with her
request, again offered her his arm. But anxious as they
evidently were to quit the house, they were not allowed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
to do so without experiencing another shock.
Just as they were passing the door of the room where the
wounded woman lay, the physician in attendance again
appeared before them with that silently uplifted hand.</p>

<p>"Hush!" said he; "she stirs again. I think she is
going to speak."</p>

<p>And once more that terrible suspense held each and
every one enthralled: once more that faint, inarticulate
murmur eddied through the house, growing gradually into
speech that this time took a form that curdled the blood
of the listeners, and made Mr. Orcutt and the young
woman at his side drop apart from each other as though
a dividing sword had passed between them.</p>

<p>"May the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'vengance'">vengeance</ins> of Heaven light upon the head of
him who has brought me to this pass," were the words
that now rose ringing and clear from that bed of death.
"May the fate that has come upon me be visited upon
him, measure for measure, blow for blow, death for
death."</p>

<p>Strange and awe-inspiring words, that drew a pall over
that house and made the dullest person there gasp for
breath. In the silence that followed&mdash;a silence that
could be felt&mdash;the white faces of lawyer and physician,
coroner and detective, turned and confronted each other.
But the young lady who lingered in their midst looked at
no one, turned to no one. Shuddering and white, she
stood gazing before her as if she already beheld that retributive
hand descending upon the head of the guilty; then,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
as she awoke to the silence of those around her, gave
a quick start and flashed forward to the door and so out
into the street before Mr. Orcutt could rouse himself sufficiently
from the stupor of the moment to follow her.</p>

<h2>III.</h2>

<h3>THE UNFINISHED LETTER.</h3>

<div class='poem'>
Faith, thou hast some crotchets in thy head now.<br />
<div class='sig'>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Merry Wives of Windsor.</span></div><br />
</div>


<div class='cap'>"WOULD there be any indiscretion in my asking
who that young lady is?" inquired Mr. Byrd
of Mr. Ferris, as, after ascertaining that the stricken sufferer
still breathed, they stood together in a distant corner
of the dining-room.</div>

<p>"No," returned the other, in a low tone, with a glance
in the direction of the lawyer, who was just re-entering
the house, after an unsuccessful effort to rejoin the person
of whom they were speaking. "She is a Miss Dare,
a young lady much admired in this town, and believed
by many to be on the verge of matrimony with&mdash;&mdash;" He
nodded toward Mr. Orcutt, and discreetly forbore to
finish the sentence.</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed the youthful detective, "I understand."
And he cast a look of suddenly awakened
interest at the man who, up to this time, he had merely
regarded as a more than usually acute criminal lawyer.</p>

<p>He saw a small, fair, alert man, of some forty years of
age, of a good carriage, easy manner, and refined cast of
countenance, overshadowed now by a secret anxiety<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
he vainly tried to conceal. He was not as handsome
as Coroner Tredwell, nor as well built as Mr. Ferris, yet
he was, without doubt, the most striking-looking man in
the room, and, to the masculine eyes of the detective,
seemed at first glance to be a person to win the admiration,
if not the affection, of women.</p>

<p>"She appears to take a great interest in this affair," he
ventured again, looking back at Mr. Ferris.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is woman's way," replied the other, lightly,
without any hint of secret feeling or curiosity. "Besides,
she is an inscrutable girl, always surprising you by
her emotions&mdash;or by her lack of them," he added, dismissing
the topic with a wave of his hand.</p>

<p>"Which is also woman's way," remarked Mr. Byrd, retiring
into his shell, from which he had momentarily
thrust his head.</p>

<p>"Does it not strike you that there are rather more
persons present than are necessary for the purposes of
justice?" asked the lawyer, now coming forward with
a look of rather pointed significance at the youthful
stranger.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris at once spoke up. "Mr. Orcutt," said he,
"let me introduce to you Mr. Byrd, of New York. He
is a member of the police force, and has been rendering
me assistance in the case just adjourned."</p>

<p>"A detective!" repeated the other, eying the young
man with a critical eye. "It is a pity, sir," he finally
observed, "that your present duties will not allow you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
to render service to justice in this case of mysterious
assault." And with a bow of more kindness than
Mr. Byrd had reason to look for, he went slowly back to
his former place near the door that hid the suffering
woman from sight.</p>

<p>However kindly expressed, Mr. Byrd felt that he had
received his dismissal, and was about to withdraw, when
the coroner, who had been absent from their midst for
the last few minutes, approached them from the foot of
the stairs, and tapped the detective on the arm.</p>

<p>"I want you," said he.</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd bowed, and with a glance toward the District
Attorney, who returned him a nod of approval, went
quickly out with the coroner.</p>

<p>"I hear you are a detective," observed the latter, taking
him up stairs into a room which he carefully locked
behind them. "A detective on the spot in a case like
this is valuable; are you willing to assume the duties of
your profession and act for justice in this matter?"</p>

<p>"Dr. Tredwell," returned the young man, instantly
conscious of a vague, inward shrinking from meddling
further in the affair, "I am not at present master of my
proceedings. To say nothing of the obedience I owe my
superiors at home, I am just now engaged in assisting
Mr. Ferris in the somewhat pressing matter now before
the court, and do not know whether it would meet with
his approval to have me mix up matters in this way."</p>

<p>"Mr. Ferris is a reasonable man," said the coroner.
"If his consent is all that is necessary&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"But it is not, sir. I must have orders from New
York."</p>

<p>"Oh, as to that, I will telegraph at once."</p>

<p>But still the young man hesitated, lounging in his
easy way against the table by which he had taken his
stand.</p>

<p>"Dr. Tredwell," he suggested, "you must have men
in this town amply able to manage such a matter as this.
A woman struck in broad daylight and a man already
taken up on suspicion! 'Tis simple, surely; intricate
measures are not wanted here."</p>

<p>"So you still think it is the tramp that struck her?"
quoth the coroner, a trifle baffled by the other's careless
manner.</p>

<p>"I still think it was not the man who sat in court all
the morning and held me fascinated by his eye."</p>

<p>"Ah, he held you fascinated, did he?" repeated the
other, a trifle suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Well, that is," Mr. Byrd allowed, with the least perceptible
loss of his easy bearing, "he made me look at
him more than once. A wandering eye always attracts
me, and his wandered constantly."</p>

<p>"Humph! and you are sure he was in the court every
minute of the morning?"</p>

<p>"There must be other witnesses who can testify to that,"
answered the detective, with the perceptible irritation of
one weary of a subject which he feels he has already
amply discussed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," declared the other, dropping his eyes from the
young man's countenance to a sheet of paper he was
holding in his hand, "whatever <i>r&ocirc;le</i> this humpback has
played in the tragedy now occupying us, whether he be a
wizard, a secret accomplice, a fool who cannot keep his
own secret, or a traitor who cannot preserve that of his
tools, this affair, as you call it, is not likely to prove the
simple matter you seem to consider it. The victim, if not
her townsfolk, knew she possessed an enemy, and this
half-finished letter which I have found on her table,
raises the question whether a common tramp, with no motive
but that of theft or brutal revenge, was the one to
meditate the fatal blow, even if he were the one to deal
it."</p>

<p>A perceptible light flickered into the eyes of Mr. Byrd,
and he glanced with a new but unmistakable interest at
the letter, though he failed to put out his hand for it, even
though the coroner held it toward him.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said he; "but if I do not take the case,
it would be better for me not to meddle any further with
it."</p>

<p>"But you are going to take it," insisted the other, with
temper, his anxiety to secure this man's services increasing
with the opposition he so unaccountably received.
"The officers at the detective bureau in New York are
not going to send another man up here when there is already
one on the spot. And a man from New York I am
determined to have. A crime like this shall not go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
unpunished in this town, whatever it may do in a great
city like yours. We don't have so many murder cases
that we need to stint ourselves in the luxury of professional
assistance."</p>

<p>"But," protested the young man, still determined to
hold back, whatever arguments might be employed or
inducements offered him, "how do you know I am the
man for your work? We have many sorts and kinds of
detectives in our bureau. Some for one kind of business,
some for another; the following up of a criminal is
not mine."</p>

<p>"What, then, is yours?" asked the coroner, not yielding
a jot of his determination.</p>

<p>The detective was silent.</p>

<p>"Read the letter," persisted Dr. Tredwell, shrewdly
conscious that if once the young man's professional
instinct was aroused, all the puerile objections which
influenced him would immediately vanish.</p>

<p>There was no resisting that air of command. Taking
the letter in his hand, the young man read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Emily</span>:&mdash;I don't know why I sit down to write to you
to-day. I have plenty to do, and morning is no time for indulging
in sentimentalities; but I feel strangely lonely and strangely anxious.
Nothing goes just to my mind, and somehow the many causes for
secret fear which I have always had, assume an undue prominence in
my mind. It is always so when I am not quite well. In vain I
reason with myself, saying that respectable people do not lightly
enter into crime. But there are so many to whom my death would
be more than welcome, that I constantly see myself in the act of
being&mdash;&mdash;"</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"Struck, shot, murdered," suggested Dr. Tredwell,
perceiving the young man's eye lingering over the broken
sentence.</p>

<p>"The words are not there," remonstrated Mr. Byrd;
but the tone of his voice showed that his professional
complacency had been disturbed at last.</p>

<p>The other did not answer, but waited with the wisdom
of the trapper who sees the quarry nosing round the
toils.</p>

<p>"There is evidently some family mystery," the young
man continued, glancing again at the letter. "But," he
remarked, "Mr. Orcutt is a good friend of hers, and can
probably tell us what it all means."</p>

<p>"Very likely," the other admitted, "if we choose to
ask him."</p>

<p>Quick as lightning the young man's glance flashed to
the coroner's face.</p>

<p>"You would rather not put the question to him?" he
inquired.</p>

<p>"No. As he is the lawyer who, in all probability, will
be employed by the criminal in this case, I am sure he
would rather not be mixed up in any preliminary investigation
of the affair."</p>

<p>The young man's eye did not waver. He appeared to
take a secret resolve.</p>

<p>"Has it not struck you," he insinuated, "that Mr.
Orcutt might have other reasons for not wishing to give
any expression of opinion in regard to it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>The surprise in the coroner's eye was his best answer.</p>

<p>"No," he rejoined.</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd at once resumed all his old nonchalance.</p>

<p>"The young lady who was here appeared to show such
agitated interest in this horrible crime, I thought that, in
kindness to her, he might wish to keep out of the affair as
much as possible."</p>

<p>"Miss Dare? Bless your heart, she would not restrict
him in any way. Her interest in the matter is purely one
of curiosity. It has been carried, perhaps, to a somewhat
unusual length for a woman of her position and
breeding. But that is all, I assure you. Miss Dare's
eccentricities are well known in this town."</p>

<p>"Then the diamond ring was really hers?" Mr. Byrd
was about to inquire, but stopped; something in his
memory of this beautiful woman made it impossible for
him to disturb the confidence of the coroner in her behalf,
at least while his own doubts were so vague and shadowy.</p>

<p>The coroner, however, observed the young detective's
hesitation, and smiled.</p>

<p>"Are you thinking of Miss Dare as having any thing to
do with this shocking affair?" he asked.</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd shook his head, but could not hide the flush
that stole up over his forehead.</p>

<p>The coroner actually laughed, a low, soft, decorous
laugh, but none the less one of decided amusement.
"Your line is not in the direction of spotting criminals,
I must allow," said he. "Why, Miss Dare is not only as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
irreproachable a young lady as we have in this town, but
she is a perfect stranger to this woman and all her concerns.
I doubt if she even knew her name till to-day."</p>

<p>A laugh is often more potent than argument. The
face of the detective lighted up, and he looked very
manly and very handsome as he returned the letter to
the coroner, saying, with a sweep of his hand as if he
tossed an unworthy doubt away forever:</p>

<p>"Well, I do not wish to appear obstinate. If this
woman dies, and the inquest fails to reveal who her
assailant is, I will apply to New York for leave to work
up the case; that is, if you continue to desire my assistance.
Meanwhile&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You will keep your eyes open," intimated the coroner,
taking back the letter and putting it carefully away in
his breast-pocket. "And now, mum!"</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd bowed, and they went together down the
stairs.</p>

<p>It was by this time made certain that the dying woman
was destined to linger on for some hours. She was completely
unconscious, and her breath barely lifted the
clothes that lay over the slowly laboring breast; but such
vitality as there was held its own with scarcely perceptible
change, and the doctor thought it might be midnight
before the solemn struggle would end. "In the meantime,
expect nothing," he exclaimed; "she has said her
last word. What remains will be a mere sinking into the
eternal sleep."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>This being so, Mr. Orcutt and Mr. Ferris decided to
leave. Mr. Byrd saw them safely out, and proceeded to
take one or two private observations of his own. They
consisted mostly in noting the precise position of the
various doors in reference to the hearth where the stick
was picked up, and the clock where the victim was
attacked. Or, so the coroner gathered from the direction
which Mr. Byrd's eye took in its travels over the scene of
action, and the diagram which he hastily drew on the
back of an envelope. The table was noticed, too, and an
inventory of its articles taken, after which he opened the
side-door and looked carefully out into the lane.</p>

<p>To observe him now with his quick eye flashing from
spot to spot, his head lifted, and a visible air of determination
infused through his whole bearing, you would
scarcely recognize the easy, gracefully indolent youth
who, but a little while before, lounged against the tables
and chairs, and met the most penetrating eye with the
sleepy gaze of a totally uninterested man. Dr. Tredwell,
alert to the change, tapped the letter in his pocket complacently.
"I have roused up a weasel," he mentally
decided, and congratulated himself accordingly.</p>

<p>It was two o'clock when Mr. Byrd went forth to join
Mr. Ferris in the court-room. As he stepped from the
door, he encountered, to all appearance, just the same
crowd that had encumbered its entrance a half hour
before. Even the old crone had not moved from her
former position, and seeing him, fairly pounced upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
him with question after question, all of which he parried
with a nonchalant dexterity that drew shout after shout
from those who stood by, and, finally, as he thought, won
him the victory, for, with an angry shake of the head, she
ceased her importunities, and presently let him pass. He
hastened to improve the chance to gain for himself the
refuge of the streets; and, having done this, stood for an
instant parleying with a trembling young girl, whose real
distress and anxiety seemed to merit some attention.
Fatal delay. In that instant the old woman had got in
front of him, and when he arrived at the head of the
street he found her there.</p>

<p>"Now," said she, with full-blown triumph in her
venomous eyes, "perhaps you will tell me something!
You think I am a mumbling old woman who don't know
what she is bothering herself about. But I tell you I've
not kept my eyes and ears open for seventy-five years in
this wicked world without knowing a bit of the devil's
own work when I see it." Here her face grew quite
hideous, and her eyes gleamed with an aspect of gloating
over the evil she alluded to, that quite sickened the young
man, accustomed though he was to the worst phases of
moral depravity. Leaning forward, she peered inquiringly
in his face. "What has <i>she</i> to do with it?" she
suddenly asked, emphasizing the pronoun with an expressive
leer.</p>

<p>"She?" he repeated, starting back.</p>

<p>"Yes, she; the pretty young lady, the pert and haughty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Miss Dare, that had but to speak to make the whole
crowd stand back. What had she to do with it, I say?
Something, or she wouldn't be here!"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you are talking about," he replied,
conscious of a strange and unaccountable dismay at thus
hearing his own passing doubt put into words by this vile
and repellent being. "Miss Dare is a stranger. She has
nothing to do either with this affair or the poor woman
who has suffered by it. Her interest is purely one of
sympathy."</p>

<p>"Hi! and you call yourself a smart one, I dare say."
And the old creature ironically chuckled. "Well, well,
well, what fools men are! They see a pretty face, and
blind themselves to what is written on it as plain as black
writing on a white wall. They call it sympathy, and never
stop to ask why she, of all the soft-hearted gals in the
town, should be the only one to burst into that house like
an avenging spirit! But it's all right," she went on, in
a bitterly satirical tone. "A crime like this can't be
covered up, however much you may try; and sooner or
later we will all know whether this young lady has had
any thing to do with Mrs. Clemmens' murder or not."</p>

<p>"Stop!" cried Mr. Byrd, struck in spite of himself by
the look of meaning with which she said these last words.
"Do you know any thing against Miss Dare which other
folks do not? If you do, speak, and let me hear at once
what it is. But&mdash;" he felt very angry, though he could
not for the moment tell why&mdash;"if you are only talking to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
gratify your spite, and have nothing to tell me except the
fact that Miss Dare appeared shocked and anxious
when she came from the widow's house just now, look out
what use you make of her name, or you will get yourself
into trouble. Mr. Orcutt and Mr. Ferris are not men to
let you go babbling round town about a young lady of
estimable character." And he tightened the grip he had
taken upon her arm and looked at her threateningly.</p>

<p>The effect was instantaneous. Slipping from his grasp,
she gazed at him with a sinister expression and edged
slowly away.</p>

<p>"I know any thing?" she repeated. "What should I
know? I only say the young lady's face tells a very
strange story. If you are too dull or too obstinate to read
it, it's nothing to me." And with another leer and
a quick look up and down the street, as if she half feared
to encounter one or both of the two lawyers whose names
he had mentioned, she marched quickly away, wagging
her head and looking back as she went, as much as to
say: "You have hushed me up for this time, young man,
but don't congratulate yourself too much. I have still a
tongue in my head, and the day may come when I
can use it without any fear of being stopped by you."</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd, who was not very well pleased with himself
or the way he had managed this interview, watched her
till she was out of sight, and then turned thoughtfully toward
the court-house. The fact was, he felt both agitated
and confused. In the first place, he was disconcerted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
at discovering the extent of the impression that
had evidently been made upon him by the beauty of Miss
Dare, since nothing short of a deep, unconscious admiration
for her personal attributes, and a strong and secret
dread of having his lately acquired confidence in her
again disturbed, could have led him to treat the insinuations
of this babbling old wretch in such a cavalier manner.
Any other detective would have seized with
avidity upon the opportunity of hearing what she had to
say on such a subject, and would not only have cajoled
her into confidence, but encouraged her to talk until she
had given utterance to all that was on her mind. But in
the stress of a feeling to which he was not anxious to
give a name, he had forgotten that he was a detective,
and remembered only that he was a man; and the consequence
was that he had frightened the old creature,
and cut short words that it was possibly his business
to hear. In the second place, he felt himself in a quandary
as regarded Miss Dare. If, as was more than possible,
she was really the innocent woman the coroner considered
her, and the insinuations, if not threats, to which
he had been listening were simply the result of a
wicked old woman's privately nurtured hatred, how could
he reconcile it to his duty as a man, or even as a detective,
to let the day pass without warning her, or the eminent
lawyer who honored her with his regard, of the
danger in which she stood from this creature's venomous
tongue.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>As he sat in court that afternoon, with his eye upon
Mr. Orcutt, beneath whose ordinary aspect of quiet, sarcastic
attention he thought he could detect the secret
workings of a deep, personal perplexity, if not of actual
alarm, he asked himself what he would wish done if
he were that man, and a scandal of a debasing character
threatened the peace of one allied to him by the
most endearing ties. "Would I wish to be informed of
it?" he queried. "I most certainly should," was his
inward reply.</p>

<p>And so it was that, after the adjournment of court, he
approached Mr. Orcutt, and leading him respectfully
aside, said, with visible reluctance:</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir, but a fact has come to my
knowledge to-day with which I think you ought to be
made acquainted. It is in reference to the young lady
who was with us at Mrs. Clemmens' house this morning.
Did you know, sir, that she had an enemy in this
town?"</p>

<p>Mr. Orcutt, whose thoughts had been very much with
that young lady since she left him so unceremoniously a
few hours before, started and looked at Mr. Byrd with
surprise which was not without its element of distrust.</p>

<p>"An enemy?" he repeated. "An enemy? What do
you mean?"</p>

<p>"What I say, Mr. Orcutt. As I came out of Mrs.
Clemmens' house this afternoon, an old hag whose name
I do not know, but whom you will probably have no difficulty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
in recognizing, seized me by the arm and made me
the recipient of insinuations and threats against Miss
Dare, which, however foolish and unfounded, betrayed an
animosity and a desire to injure her that is worthy your
attention."</p>

<p>"You are very kind," returned Mr. Orcutt, with increased
astonishment and a visible constraint, "but I do
not understand you. What insinuations or threats could
this woman have to make against a young lady of Miss
Dare's position and character?"</p>

<p>"It is difficult for me to tell you," acknowledged Mr.
Byrd; "but the vicious old creature presumed to say that
Miss Dare must have had a special and secret interest in
this murder, or she would not have gone as she did to that
house. Of course," pursued the detective, discreetly
dropping his eyes from the lawyer's face, "I did what I
could to show her the folly of her suspicions, and tried to
make her see the trouble she would bring upon herself if
she persisted in expressing them; but I fear I only succeeded
in quieting her for the moment, and that she will
soon be attacking others with this foolish story."</p>

<p>Mr. Orcutt who, whatever his own doubts or apprehensions,
could not fail to be totally unprepared for a
communication of this kind, gave utterance to a fierce
and bitter exclamation, and fixed upon the detective his
keen and piercing eye.</p>

<p>"Tell me just what she said," he demanded.</p>

<p>"I will try to do so," returned Mr. Byrd. And calling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
to his aid a very excellent memory, he gave a <i>verbatim</i>
account of the conversation that had passed between him
and the old woman. Mr. Orcutt listened, as he always
did, without interruption or outward demonstration; but
when the recital was over and Mr. Byrd ventured to look
at him once more, he noticed that he was very pale and
greatly changed in expression. Being himself in a position
to understand somewhat of the other's emotion, he
regained by an effort the air of polite nonchalance that
became him so well, and quickly suggested: "Miss Dare
will, of course, be able to explain herself."</p>

<p>The lawyer flashed upon him a quick glance.</p>

<p>"I hope you have no doubts on the subject," he said;
then, as the detective's eye fell a trifle before his, paused
and looked at him with the self-possession gained in fifteen
years of practice in the criminal courts, and said:
"I am Miss Dare's best friend. I know her well, and
can truly say that not only is her character above reproach,
but that I am acquainted with no circumstances
that could in any way connect her with this crime. Nevertheless,
the incidents of the day have been such as to
make it desirable for her to explain herself, and this, as
you say, she will probably have no difficulty in doing. If
you will, therefore, wait till to-morrow before taking any
one else into your confidence, I promise you to see Miss
Dare myself, and, from her own lips, learn the cause of
her peculiar interest in this affair. Meanwhile, let me
request you to put a curb upon your imagination, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
not allow it to soar too high into the regions of idle speculation."</p>

<p>And he held out his hand to the detective with a smile
whose vain attempt at unconcern affected Mr. Byrd more
than a violent outbreak would have done. It betrayed
so unmistakably that his own secret doubts were not
without an echo in the breast of this eminent lawyer.</p>

<h2>IV.</h2>

<h3>IMOGENE.</h3>

<div class='center'>
You are a riddle, solve you who can.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Knowles.</span><br />
<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>MR. ORCUTT was a man who for many years had
turned a deaf ear and a cold eye to the various
attractions and beguilements of woman. Either from
natural coldness of disposition, or for some other latent
cause, traceable, perhaps, to some fact in his past history,
and not to be inquired into by gossiping neighbors and
so-called friends, he had resisted, even to the point of
disdain, both the blandishments of acknowledged belles,
and the more timid but no less pleasing charms of the
shy country misses that he met upon his travels.</div>

<p>But one day all this was changed. Imogene Dare
entered his home, awakening a light in the dim old place
that melted his heart and made a man out of what was
usually considered a well-ordered machine.</p>

<p>She had been a foundling. Yes, this beautiful, disdainful,
almost commanding woman, had in the beginning
been that most unfortunate of beings&mdash;a child without a
name. But though this fact may have influenced the
course of her early days, it gradually disappeared from
notice as she grew up and developed, till in Sibley, at
least, it became wellnigh a fact forgotten. Her beauty,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
as well as the imposing traits of her character, was the
cause. There are some persons so gifted with natural
force that, once brought in contact with them, you forget
their antecedents, and, indeed, every thing but themselves.
Either their beauty overawes you or they, by conversation
or bearing, so completely satisfy you of their right
to your respect, that indifference takes the place of curiosity,
and you yield your regard as if you have already
yielded your admiration, without question and without
stint.</p>

<p>The early years of her life were passed in the house of
a poor widow, to whom the appearance of this child on
her door-step one fine day had been nothing more nor less
than a veritable godsend. First, because she was herself
alone in the world, and needed the mingled companionship
and care which a little one invariably gives; and,
secondly, because Imogene, from the very first, had been
a noticeable child, who early attracted the attention of
the neighbors, and led to many a substantial evidence of
favor from them, as well as from the strangers who
passed their gate or frequented their church. Insensibly
to herself, and without help of circumstances or rearing,
the girl was a magnet toward which all good things insensibly
tended; and the widow saw this, and, while
reaping the reward, stinted neither her affection nor her
gratitude.</p>

<p>When Imogene was eleven, this protector of her infancy
died. But another home instantly offered. A wealthy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
couple of much kindness, if little culture, adopted her as
their child, and gave her every benefit in life save education.
This never having possessed themselves, they
openly undervalued. But she was not to be kept down
by the force of any circumstances, whether favorable or
otherwise. All the graces of manner and refinements of
thought which properly belong to the station she had now
attained, but which, in the long struggle after wealth, had
escaped the honest couple that befriended her, became
by degrees her own, tempering without destroying her individuality,
any more than the new life of restraint that
now governed her physical powers, was able to weaken or
subdue that rare and splendid physique which had been
her fairest birthright.</p>

<p>In the lap of luxury, therefore, and in full possession
of means to come and go and conform herself to the
genteel world and its fashions, she passed the next four
years; but scarcely had she attained the age of fifteen,
when bankruptcy, followed by death, again robbed her of
her home and set her once more adrift upon the world.</p>

<p>This time she looked to no one for assistance. Refusing
all offers, many of them those of honorable marriage,
she sought for work, and after a short delay found it in
the household of Mr. Orcutt. The aged sister who
governed his home and attended to all its domestic
details, hired her as a sort of assistant, rightly judging
that the able young body and the alert hand would bring
into the household economy just that life and interest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
which her own failing strength had now for some time refused
to supply.</p>

<p>That the girl was a beauty and something more, who
could not from the nature of things be kept in that subordinate
position, she either failed to see, or, seeing, was
pleased to disregard. She never sought to impose restraint
upon the girl any more than she did upon her
brother, when in the course of events she saw that his
eye was at last attracted and his imagination fired by the
noble specimen of girlhood that made its daily appearance
at his own board.</p>

<p>That she had introduced a dangerous element into that
quiet home, that ere long would devastate its sacred precincts,
and endanger, if not destroy, its safety and honor,
she had no reason to suspect. What was there in youth,
beauty, and womanly power that one should shrink from
their embodiment and tremble as if an evil instead of a
good had entered that hitherto undisturbed household?
Nothing, if they had been all. But alas for her, and alas
for him&mdash;they were not all! Mixed with the youth,
beauty, and power was a something else not to be so
readily understood&mdash;a something, too, which, without
offering explanation to the fascinated mind that studied
her, made the beauty unique, the youth a charm, and the
power a controlling force. She was not to be sounded.
Going and coming, smiling and frowning, in movement or
at rest, she was always a mystery; the depths of her being
remaining still in hiding, however calmly she spoke or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
however graciously she turned upon you the light of her
deep gray eyes.</p>

<p>Mr. Orcutt loved her. From the first vision he had of
her face and form dominating according to their nature
at his board and fireside, he had given up his will into her
unconscious keeping. She was so precisely what all
other women he had known were not. At first so distant,
so self-contained, so unapproachable in her pride; then
as her passion grew for books, so teachable, so industrious,
so willing to listen to his explanations and arguments;
and lastly&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But that did not come at once. A long struggle took
place between those hours when he used to encourage
her to come into his study and sit at his side, and read
from his books, and the more dangerous time still, when
he followed her into the drawing-room and sat at her side,
and sought to read, not from books, but from her eyes,
the story of his own future fate.</p>

<p>For, powerful as was his passion and deeply as his
heart had been touched, he did not yield to the thought
of marriage which such a passion involves, without a conflict.
He would make her his child, the heiress of his
wealth, and the support of his old age; this was his first
resolve. But it did not last; the first sight he had of her
on her return from a visit to Buffalo, which he had insisted
upon her making during the time of his greatest
mental conflict, had assured him that this could never
be; that he must be husband and she wife, or else their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
relations must entirely cease. Perhaps the look with
which she met him had something to do with this. It
was such a blushing, humble&mdash;yes, for her, really humble
and beautiful&mdash;look. He could not withstand it.
Though no one could have detected it in his manner,
he really succumbed in that hour. Doubt and hesitation
flew to the winds, and to make her his own became the
sole aim and object of his life.</p>

<p>He did not, however, betray his purpose at once.
Neighbors and friends might and did suspect the state of
his feelings, but to her he was silent. That vague something
which marked her off from the rest of her sex,
seemed to have deepened in her temporary sojourn from
his side, and whatever it meant of good or of ill, it taught
him at least to be wary. At last, was it with premeditation
or was it in some moment of uncontrollable impulse,
he spoke; not with definite pleading, or even with any
very clear intimation that he desired some day to make
her his wife, but in a way that sufficed to tear the veil
from their previous intercourse and let her catch a
glimpse, if no more, of his heart, and its devouring passion.</p>

<p>He was absolutely startled at the result. She avowed
that she had never thought of his possessing such a regard
for her; and for two days shut herself up in her
room and refused to see either him or his sister. Then
she came down, blooming like a rose, but more distant,
more quiet, and more inscrutable than ever. Pride, if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
pride she felt, was subdued under a general aspect of
womanly dignity that for a time held all further avowals
in check, and made all intercourse between them at once
potent in its attraction and painful in its restraint.</p>

<p>"She is waiting for a distinct offer of marriage," he
decided.</p>

<p>And thus matters stood, notwithstanding the general
opinion of their friends, when the terrible event recorded
in the foregoing chapters of this story brought her in
a new light before his eyes, and raised a question, shocking
as it was unexpected, as to whether this young girl,
immured as he had believed her to be in his own home,
had by some unknown and inexplicable means run upon
the secret involving, if not explaining, the mystery of this
dreadful and daring crime.</p>

<p>Such an idea was certainly a preposterous one to entertain.
He neither could nor would believe she knew more
of this matter than any other disinterested person in town,
and yet there had certainly been something in her bearing
upon the scene of tragedy, that suggested a personal interest
in the affair; nor could he deny that he himself
had been struck by the incongruity of her behavior long
before it attracted the attention of others.</p>

<p>But then he had opportunities for judging of her conduct
which others did not have. He not only had every
reason to believe that the ring to which she had so publicly
laid claim was not her own, but he had observed how,
at the moment the dying woman had made that tell-tale exclamation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
of "<i>Ring</i> and <i>Hand!</i>" Miss Dare had looked
down at the jewel she had thus appropriated, with a
quick horror and alarm that seemed to denote she had
some knowledge of its owner, or some suspicion, at least,
as to whose hand had worn it before she placed it upon
her own.</p>

<p>It was not, therefore, a matter of wonder that he was
visibly affected at finding her conduct had attracted the
attention of others, and one of those a detective, or that
the walk home after his interview with Mr. Byrd should
have been fraught with a dread to which he scarcely
dared to give a name.</p>

<p>The sight of Miss Dare coming down the path as he
reached his own gate did not tend to greatly allay his apprehensions,
particularly as he observed she was dressed
in travelling costume, and carried a small satchel on her
arm.</p>

<p>"Imogene," he cried, as she reached him, "what is the
meaning of this? Where are you going?"</p>

<p>Her face, which wore a wholly unnatural and strained
expression, turned slowly toward his.</p>

<p>"I am going to Buffalo," she said.</p>

<p>"To Buffalo?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>This was alarming, surely. She was going to leave the
town&mdash;leave it suddenly, without excuse or explanation!</p>

<p>Looking at her with eyes which, for all their intense
inquiry, conveyed but little of the serious emotions that
were agitating his mind, he asked, hurriedly:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"What takes you to Buffalo&mdash;to-day&mdash;so suddenly?"</p>

<p>Her answer was set and mechanical.</p>

<p>"I have had news. One of my&mdash;my friends is not well.
I must go. Do not detain me."</p>

<p>And she moved quickly toward the gate.</p>

<p>But his tremulous hand was upon it, and he made no
offer to open a passage for her.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," said he, "but I cannot let you go till I
have had some conversation with you. Come with me to
the house, Imogene. I will not detain you long."</p>

<p>But with a sad and abstracted gesture she slowly shook
her head.</p>

<p>"It is too late," she murmured. "I shall miss the train
if I stop now."</p>

<p>"Then you must miss it," he cried, bitterly, forgetting
every thing else in the torture of his uncertainty. "What
I have to say cannot wait. Come!"</p>

<p>This tone of command from one who had hitherto
adapted himself to her every whim, seemed to strike her.
Paling quickly, she for the first time looked at him with
something like a comprehension of his feelings, and
quietly replied:</p>

<p>"Forgive me. I had forgotten for the moment the
extent of your claims upon me. I will wait till to-morrow
before going." And she led the way back to the house.</p>

<p>When they were alone together in the library, he turned
toward her with a look whose severity was the fruit of
his condition of mind rather than of any natural harshness
or imperiousness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">&quot;Taking her hand in his, he looked at her long and searchingly. &#39;Imogene,&#39; he exclaimed, &#39;there is something weighing on your heart.&#39;&quot;&mdash;(Page 58.)</span>
</div>
<p>"Now, Imogene," said he, "tell me why you desire to
leave my house."</p>

<p>Her face, which had assumed a mask of cold impassiveness,
confronted him like that of a statue, but her voice,
when she spoke, was sufficiently gentle.</p>

<p>"Mr. Orcutt," was her answer, "I have told you. I
have a call elsewhere which must be attended to. I do
not leave your house; I merely go to Buffalo for a few
days."</p>

<p>But he could not believe this short statement of her
intentions. In the light of these new fears of his, this
talk of Buffalo, and a call there, looked to him like the
merest subterfuge. Yet her gentle tone was not without
its effect, and his voice visibly softened as he said:</p>

<p>"You are intending, then, to return?"</p>

<p>Her reply was prefaced by a glance of amazement.</p>

<p>"Of course," she responded at last. "Is not this
my home?"</p>

<p>Something in the way she said this carried a ray of
hope to his heart. Taking her hand in his, he looked at
her long and searchingly.</p>

<p>"Imogene!" he exclaimed, "there is something serious
weighing upon your heart. What is it? Will you not
make me the confidant of your troubles? Tell me what
has made such a change in you since&mdash;since noon, and its
dreadful event."</p>

<p>But her expression did not soften, and her manner became
even more reserved than before.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have not any thing to tell," said she.</p>

<p>"Not any thing?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"Not any thing."</p>

<p>Dropping her hand, he communed a moment with himself.
That a secret of possible consequence lay between
them he could not doubt. That it had reference to and
involved the crime of the morning, he was equally sure.
But how was he to make her acknowledge it? How was
he to reach her mind and determine its secrets without
alarming her dignity or wounding her heart?</p>

<p>To press her with questions seemed impossible. Even
if he could have found words with which to formulate his
fears, her firm, set face, and steady, unrelenting eye,
assured him only too plainly that the attempt would
be met by failure, if it did not bring upon him her
scorn and contempt. No; some other method must
be found; some way that would completely and at once
ease his mind of a terrible weight, and yet involve no risk
to the love that had now become the greatest necessity of
his existence. But what way? With all his acumen and
knowledge of the world, he could think of but one.
He would ask her hand in marriage&mdash;aye, at this very moment&mdash;and
from the tenor of her reply judge of the
nature of her thoughts. For, looking in her face, he felt
forced to acknowledge that whatever doubts he had
ever cherished in reference to the character of this remarkable
girl, upon one point he was perfectly clear, and
this was, that she was at basis honorable in her instincts,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and would never do herself or another a real injustice. If
a distinct wrong or even a secret of an unhappy or debasing
nature lay between them, he knew that nothing, not
even the bitterest necessity or the most headlong passion,
would ever drive her into committing the dishonor of
marrying him.</p>

<p>No; if with his declaration in her ears, and with his
eyes fixed upon hers, she should give any token of
her willingness to accept his addresses, he felt he might
know, beyond doubt or cavil, that whatever womanish
excitability may have moved her in her demonstrations
that day, they certainly arose from no private knowledge
or suspicion detrimental to his future peace or to hers.</p>

<p>Bracing himself, therefore, to meet any result that
might follow his attempt, he drew her gently toward him
and determinedly addressed her.</p>

<p>"Imogene, I told you at the gate that I had something
to say to you. So I have; and though it may
not be wholly unexpected to you, yet I doubt if it would
have left my lips to-night if the events of the day had not
urged me to offer you my sympathy and protection."</p>

<p>He paused, almost sickened; at that last phrase
she had grown so terribly white and breathless. But
something in her manner, notwithstanding, seemed to
encourage him to proceed, and smothering his doubts,
trampling, as it were, upon his rising apprehensions,
he calmed down his tone and went quietly on:</p>

<p>"Imogene, I love you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>She did not shrink.</p>

<p>"Imogene, I want you for my wife. Will you listen to
my prayer, and make my home forever happy with your
presence?"</p>

<p>Ah, now she showed feeling; now she started and drew
back, putting out her hands as if the idea he had
advanced was insupportable to her. But it was only for
a moment. Before he could say to himself that it was all
over, that his worst fears had been true, and that nothing
but the sense of some impassable gulf between them
could have made her recoil from him like this, she
had dropped her hands and turned toward him with
a look whose deep inquiry and evident struggle after
an understanding of his claims, spoke of a mind clouded
by trouble, but not alienated from himself by fear.</p>

<p>She did not speak, however,&mdash;not for some few minutes,
and when she did, her words came in short and hurried
gasps.</p>

<p>"You are kind," was what she said. "To be your&mdash;wife"&mdash;she
had difficulty in uttering the word, but it
came at last&mdash;"would be an honor and a protection. I
appreciate both. But I am in no mood to-night to listen
to words of love from any man. Perhaps six months
hence&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But he already had her in his arms. The joy and relief
he felt were so great he could not control himself.
"Imogene," he murmured, "my Imogene!" And
scarcely heeded her when, in a burst of subdued agony,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
she asked to be released, saying that she was ill and tired,
and must be allowed to withdraw to her room.</p>

<p>But a second appeal woke him from his dream. If his
worst fears were without foundation; if her mind was
pure of aught that unfitted her to be his wife, there was
yet much that was mysterious in her conduct, and, consequently,
much which he longed to have explained.</p>

<p>"Imogene," he said, "I must ask you to remain a
moment longer. Hard as it is for me to distress you,
there is a question which I feel it necessary to put to you
before you go. It is in reference to the fearful crime
which took place to-day. Why did you take such an interest
in it, and why has it had such an effect upon you
that you look like a changed woman to-night?"</p>

<p>Disengaging herself from his arms, she looked at him
with the set composure of one driven to bay, and asked:</p>

<p>"Is there any thing strange in my being interested in a
murder perpetrated on a person whose name I have frequently
heard mentioned in this house?"</p>

<p>"No," he murmured, "no; but what led you to her
home? It was not a spot for a young lady to be in, and
any other woman would have shrunk from so immediate
a contact with crime."</p>

<p>Imogene's hand was on the door, but she turned back.</p>

<p>"I am not like other women," she declared. "When I
hear of any thing strange or mysterious, I want to understand
it. I did not stop to ask what people would think
of my conduct."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"But your grief and terror, Imogene? They are real,
and not to be disguised. Look in the glass over there,
and you will yourself see what an effect all this has had
upon you. If Mrs. Clemmens is a stranger to you; if you
know no more of her than you have always led me to suppose,
why should you have been so unnaturally impressed
by to-day's tragedy?"</p>

<p>It was a searching question, and her eye fell slightly,
but her steady demeanor did not fail her.</p>

<p>"Still," said she, "because I am not like other women.
I cannot forget such horrors in a moment." And she
advanced again to the door, upon which she laid her
hand.</p>

<p>Unconsciously his eye followed the movement, and
rested somewhat inquiringly upon that hand. It was
gloved, but to all appearance was without the ring which
he had seen her put on at the widow's house.</p>

<p>She seemed to comprehend his look. Meeting his eye
with unshaken firmness, she resumed, in a low and constrained
voice:</p>

<p>"You are wondering about the ring that formed a
portion of the scene we are discussing. Mr. Orcutt, I
told the gentleman who handed it to me to-day that it
was mine. That should be enough for the man who
professes sufficient confidence in me to wish to make me
his wife. But since your looks confess a curiosity in
regard to this diamond, I will say that I was as much astonished
as anybody to see it picked up from the floor at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
my feet. The last time I had seen it was when I dropped
it, somewhat recklessly, into a pocket. How or when it
fell out, I cannot say. As for the ring itself," she haughtily
added, "young ladies frequently possess articles of
whose existence their friends are unconscious."</p>

<p>Here was an attempt at an explanation which, though
meagre and far from satisfactory, had at least a basis in
possibility. But Mr. Orcutt, as I have before said, was
certain that the ring was lying on the floor of the room
where it was picked up, before Imogene had made her
appearance there, and was therefore struck with dismay
at this conclusive evidence of her falsehood.</p>

<p>Yet, as he said to himself, she might have some association
with the ring, might even have an owner's claim
upon it, incredible as this appeared, without being in the
possession of such knowledge as definitely connected it
with this crime. And led by this hope he laid his hand
on hers as it was softly turning the knob of the door, and
said, with emotion:</p>

<p>"Imogene, one moment. This is a subject which I am
as anxious to drop as you are. In your condition it is
almost cruelty to urge it upon you, but of one thing I
must be assured before you leave my presence, and that
is, that whatever secrets you may hide in your soul, or
whatever motive may have governed your treatment of me
and my suit to-night, they do not spring from any real or
supposed interest in this crime, which ought from its
nature to separate you and me. I ask," he quickly added,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
as he saw her give a start of injured pride or irrepressible
dismay, "not because I have any doubts on the subject
myself, but because some of the persons who have
unfortunately been witness to your strange and excited
conduct to-day, have presumed to hint that nothing short of
a secret knowledge of the crime or criminal could explain
your action upon the scene of tragedy."</p>

<p>And with a look which, if she had observed it, might
have roused her to a sense of the critical position in which
she stood, he paused and held his breath for her reply.</p>

<p>It did not come.</p>

<p>"Imogene?"</p>

<p>"I hear."</p>

<p>Cold and hard the words sounded&mdash;his hand went like
lightning to his heart.</p>

<p>"Are you going to answer?" he asked, at last.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What is that answer to be, Yes or No?"</p>

<p>She turned upon him her large gray eyes. There was
misery in their depths, but there was a haughtiness, also,
which only truth could impart.</p>

<p>"My answer is No!" said she.</p>

<p>And, without another word, she glided from the room.</p>

<p>Next morning, Mr. Byrd found three notes awaiting
his perusal. The first was a notification from the coroner
to the effect that the Widow Clemmens had quietly
breathed her last at midnight. The second, a hurried
line from Mr. Ferris, advising him to make use of the day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
in concluding a certain matter of theirs in the next town;
and the third, a letter from Mr. Orcutt, couched in the
following terms:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Mr. Byrd</span>: <i>Dear Sir</i>&mdash;I have seen the person named between
us, and I here state, upon my honor, that she is in possession of no
facts which it concerns the authorities to know.</p>

<h3>HORACE BYRD.</h3>

<div class='poem'>
But now, I am cabin'd, cribbed, confin'd, bound in<br />
To saucy doubts and fears.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Macbeth.</span><br />
<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>HORACE BYRD was by birth and education a
gentleman. He was the son of a man of small
means but great expectations, and had been reared to
look forward to the day when he should be the possessor
of a large income. But his father dying, both means and
expectations vanished into thin air, and at the age of
twenty, young Horace found himself thrown upon the
world without income, without business, and, what was
still worse, without those habits of industry that serve a
man in such an emergency better than friends and often
better than money itself.</div>

<p>He had also an invalid mother to look after, and two
young sisters whom he loved with warm and devoted
affection; and though by the kindness and forethought
of certain relatives he was for a time spared all anxiety
on their account, he soon found that some exertion on
his part would be necessary to their continued subsistence,
and accordingly set about the task of finding suitable
employment, with much spirit and no little hope.</p>

<p>But a long series of disappointments taught him that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
young men cannot leap at a bound into a fine salary or
even a promising situation; and baffled in every wish,
worn out with continued failures, he sank from one state
of hope to another, till he was ready to embrace any
prospect that would insure ease and comfort to the helpless
beings he so much loved.</p>

<p>It was while he was in this condition that Mr. Gryce&mdash;a
somewhat famous police detective of New York&mdash;came
upon him, and observing, as he thought, some signs of
natural aptitude for <i>fine work</i>, as he called it, in this
elegant but decidedly hard-pushed young gentleman, seized
upon him with an avidity that can only be explained by
this detective's long-cherished desire to ally to himself a
man of real refinement and breeding; having, as he
privately admitted more than once to certain chosen
friends, a strong need of such a person to assist him in
certain cases where great houses were to be entered and
fine gentlemen if not fair ladies subjected to interviews of
a delicate and searching nature.</p>

<p>To join the police force and be a detective was the last
contingency that had occurred to Horace Byrd. But
men in decidedly straitened circumstances cannot pick
and choose too nicely; and after a week of uncertainty
and fresh disappointment, he went manfully to his mother
and told her of the offer that had been made him. Meeting
with less discouragement than he had expected from the
broken-down and unhappy woman, he gave himself up to
the guiding hand of Mr. Gryce, and before he realized it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
was enrolled among the secret members of the New York
force.</p>

<p>He was not recognized publicly as a detective. His
name was not even known to any but the highest officials.
He was employed for special purposes, and it was not
considered desirable that he should be seen at police
head-quarters. But being a man of much ability and of a
solid, reliable nature, he made his way notwithstanding,
and by the time he had been in the service a year, was
looked upon as a good-fellow and a truly valuable acquisition
to the bureau. Indeed, he possessed more than the
usual qualifications for his calling, strange as the fact
appeared not only to himself but to the few friends
acquainted with his secret. In the first place, he possessed
much acuteness without betraying it. Of an easy
bearing and a polished address, he was a man to please
all and alarm none, yet he always knew what he was
about and what you were about, too, unless indeed you
possessed a power of dissimulation much beyond ordinary,
when the chances were that his gentlemanly instincts
would get in his way, making it impossible for him to
believe in a guilt that was too hardy to betray itself, and
too insensible to shame to blush before the touch of the
inquisitor.</p>

<p>In the second place, he liked the business. Yes, notwithstanding
the theories of that social code to which he
once paid deference, notwithstanding the frankness and
candor of his own disposition, he found in this pursuit a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
nice adjustment of cause to effect and effect to cause
that at once pleased and satisfied his naturally mathematical
mind.</p>

<p>He did not acknowledge the fact, not even to himself.
On the contrary, he was always threatening that in another
month he should look up some new means of livelihood,
but the coming month would invariably bring a fresh case
before his notice, and then it would be: "Well, after this
matter is probed to the bottom," or, "When that criminal
is made to confess his guilt," till even his little sisters
caught the infection, and would whisper over their dolls:</p>

<p>"Brother Horace is going to be a great man when all
the bad and naughty people in the world are put in
prison."</p>

<p>As a rule, Mr. Byrd was not sent out of town. But, on
the occasion of Mr. Ferris desiring a man of singular discretion
to assist him in certain inquiries connected with
the case then on trial in Sibley, there happened to be a
deficiency of capable men in the bureau, and the superintendent
was obliged to respond to the call by sending Mr.
Byrd. He did not do it, however, without making the
proviso that all public recognition of this officer, in his
real capacity, was to be avoided. And so far the wishes
of his superiors had been respected. No one outside of
the few persons mentioned in the first chapter of this
story suspected that the easy, affable, and somewhat distinguished-looking
young gentleman who honored the
village hotel with his patronage was a secret emissary of
the New York police.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Byrd was, of all men, then, the very one to feel the
utmost attraction toward, and at the same time the
greatest shrinking from, the pursuit of such investigations
as were likely to ensue upon the discovery of the mysterious
case of murder which had so unexpectedly been
presented to his notice. As a professional, he could not
fail to experience that quick start of the blood which
always follows the recognition of a "big affair," while as
a gentleman, he felt himself recoil from probing into a
matter that was blackened by a possibility against which
every instinct in his nature rebelled.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, with oddly mingled sensations that
he read Mr. Orcutt's letter, and found himself compelled
to admit that the coroner had possessed a truer insight
than himself into the true cause of Miss Dare's eccentric
conduct upon the scene of the tragedy. His main feeling,
however, was one of relief. It was such a comfort to
think he could proceed in the case without the dread of
stumbling upon a clue that, in some secret and unforeseen
way, should connect this imposing woman with a revolting
crime. Or so he fondly considered. But he had not spent
five minutes at the railroad station, where, in pursuance
to the commands of Mr. Ferris, he went to take the train
for Monteith, before he saw reason to again change his
mind. For, there among the passengers awaiting the
New York express, he saw Miss Dare, with a travelling-bag
upon her arm and a look on her face that, to say the
least, was of most uncommon character in a scene of so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
much bustle and hurry. She was going away, then&mdash;going
to leave Sibley and its mystery behind her! He was not
pleased with the discovery. This sudden departure
looked too much like escape, and gave him, notwithstanding
the assurance he had received from Mr. Orcutt, an
uneasy sense of having tampered with his duty as an
officer of justice, in thus providing this mysterious young
woman with a warning that could lead to a result like
this.</p>

<p>Yet, as he stood at the depot surveying Miss Dare, in
the few minutes they both had to wait, he asked himself
over and over again how any thought of her possessing a
personal interest in the crime which had just taken place
could retain a harbor in his mind. She looked so noble
in her quiet aspect of solemn determination, so superior
in her young, fresh beauty&mdash;a determination that, from
the lofty look it imparted, must have its birth in generous
emotion, even if her beauty was but the result of a rarely
modelled frame and a health of surpassing perfection.
He resolved he would think of her no more in that or any
other connection; that he would follow the example of
her best friend, and give his doubts to the wind.</p>

<p>And yet such a burr is suspicion, that he no sooner saw
a young man approaching her with the evident intention
of speaking, than he felt an irresistible desire to hear
what she would have to say, and, led by this impulse,
allowed himself to saunter nearer and nearer the pair, till
he stood almost at their backs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>The first words he heard were:</p>

<p>"How long do you expect to remain in Buffalo, Miss
Dare?"</p>

<p>To which she replied:</p>

<p>"I have no idea whether I shall stay a week or a
month."</p>

<p>Then the whistle of the advancing train was heard, and
the two pressed hurriedly forward.</p>

<p>The business which had taken Mr. Byrd to Monteith
kept him in that small town all day. But though he thus
missed the opportunity of attending the opening of the
inquest at Sibley, he did not experience the vivid disappointment
which might have been expected, his interest
in that matter having in some unaccountable way subsided
from the moment he saw Imogene Dare take the cars for
Buffalo.</p>

<p>It was five o'clock when he again returned to Sibley,
the hour at which the western train was also due. In
fact, it came steaming in while he stood there, and, as
was natural, perhaps, he paused a moment to watch the
passengers alight. There were not many, and he was
about to turn toward home, when he saw a lady step
upon the platform whose appearance was so familiar that
he stopped, disbelieving the evidence of his own senses.
Miss Dare returned? Miss Dare, who but a few hours
before had left this very depot for the purpose, as she
said, of making a visit of more or less length in the distant
city of Buffalo? It could not be. And yet there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
was no mistaking her, disguised though she was by the
heavy veil that covered her features. She had come
back, and the interest which Mr. Byrd had lost in Sibley
and its possible mystery, revived with a suddenness that
called up a self-conscious blush to his hardy cheek.</p>

<p>But why had she so changed her plans? What could
have occurred during the few hours that had elapsed
since her departure, to turn her about on her path and
drive her homeward before her journey was half completed?
He could not imagine. True, it was not his
present business to do so; and yet, however much he endeavored
to think of other things, he found this question
occupying his whole mind long after his return to the
village hotel. She was such a mystery, this woman, it
might easily be that she had never intended to go to Buffalo;
that she had only spoken of that place as the point
of her destination under the stress of her companion's
importunities, and that the real place for which she was
bound had been some spot very much nearer home. The
fact, that her baggage had consisted only of a small bag
that she carried on her arm, would lend probability to this
idea, yet, such was the generous character of the young
detective, he hesitated to give credit to this suspicion, and
indeed took every pains to disabuse himself of it by inquiring
of the ticket-agent, whether it was true, as he had
heard, that Miss Dare had left town on that day for a
visit to her friends in Buffalo.</p>

<p>He received for his reply that she had bought a ticket<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
for that place, though she evidently had not used it, a
fact which seemed at least to prove she was honest in the
expression of her intentions that morning, whatever alteration
may have taken place in her plans during the course
of her journey.</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd did not enjoy his supper that night, and was
heartily glad when, in a few moments after its completion,
Mr. Ferris came in for a chat and a cigar.</p>

<p>They had many things to discuss. First, their own
case now drawing to a successful close; next, the murder
of the day before; and lastly, the few facts which had
been elicited in regard to that murder, in the inquiry
which had that day been begun before the coroner.</p>

<p>Of the latter Mr. Ferris spoke with much interest. He
had attended the inquest himself, and, though he had not
much to communicate&mdash;the time having been mainly
taken up in selecting and swearing in a jury&mdash;a few witnesses
had been examined and certain conclusions
reached, which certainly added greatly to the impression
already made upon the public mind, that an affair of
great importance had arisen; an affair, too, promising
more in the way of mystery than the simple nature of its
earlier manifestations gave them reason to suppose.</p>

<p>In the first place, the widow had evidently been assaulted
with a deliberate purpose and a serious intent to
slay.</p>

<p>Secondly, no immediate testimony was forthcoming
calculated to point with unerring certainty to the guilty
party.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>To be sure, the tramp and the hunchback still offered
possibilities of suspicion; but even they were slight, the
former having been seen to leave the widow's house
without entering, and the latter having been proved beyond
a question to have come into town on the morning
train and to have gone at once to court where he remained
till the time they all saw him disappear down the
street.</p>

<p>That the last-mentioned individual may have had some
guilty knowledge of the crime was possible enough. The
fact of his having wiped himself out so completely as to
elude all search, was suspicious in itself, but if he was
connected with the assault it must have been simply as an
accomplice employed to distract public attention from
the real criminal; and in a case like this, the interest
naturally centres with the actual perpetrator; and the
question was now and must be: Who was the man who,
in broad daylight, dared to enter a house situated like
this in a thickly populated street, and kill with a blow an
inoffensive woman?</p>

<p>"I cannot imagine," declared Mr. Ferris, as his communication
reached this point. "It looks as if she had
an enemy, but what enemy could such a person as she
possess&mdash;a woman who always did her own work, attended
to her own affairs, and made it an especial rule of her
life never to meddle with those of anybody else?"</p>

<p>"Was she such a woman?" inquired Mr. Byrd, to
whom as yet no knowledge had come of the widow's life,
habits, or character.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. In all the years I have been in this town I have
never heard of her visiting any one or encouraging any
one to visit her. Had it not been for Mr. Orcutt, she
would have lived the life of a recluse. As it was, she was
the most methodical person in her ways that I ever knew.
At just such an hour she rose; at just such an hour put
on her kettle, cooked her meal, washed her dishes, and sat
herself down to her sewing or whatever work it was she
had to do. The dinner was the only meal that waited,
and that, Mr. Orcutt says, was always ready and done to
a turn at whatever moment he chose to present himself."</p>

<p>"Had she no intimates, no relatives?" asked Mr.
Byrd, remembering that fragment of a letter he had read&mdash;a
letter which certainly contradicted this assertion in
regard to her even and quiet life.</p>

<p>"None that I am aware of," was the response. "Wait,
I believe I have been told she has a nephew somewhere&mdash;a
sister's son, for whom she had some regard and to whom
she intended to leave her money."</p>

<p>"She had money, then?"</p>

<p>"Some five thousand, maybe. Reports differ about
such matters."</p>

<p>"And this nephew, where does he live?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you. I don't know as any one can. My
remembrances in regard to him are of the vaguest character."</p>

<p>"Five thousand dollars is regarded as no mean sum in
a town like this," quoth Mr. Byrd, carelessly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know it. She is called quite rich by many. How
she got her money no one knows; for when she first
came here she was so poor she had to eat and sleep all in
one room. Mr. Orcutt paid her something for his daily
dinner, of course, but that could not have enabled her to
put ten dollars in the bank as she has done every week
for the last ten years. And to all appearances she has
done nothing else for her living. You see, we have paid
attention to her affairs, if she has paid none to ours."</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd again remembered that scrap of a letter which
had been shown him by the coroner, and thought to himself
that their knowledge was in all probability less than
they supposed.</p>

<p>"Who was that horrid crone I saw shouldering herself
through the crowd that collected around the gate yesterday?"
was his remark, however. "Do you remember a
wizen, toothless old wretch, whose eye has more of the
Evil One in it than that of many a young thief you see
locked up in the county jails?"</p>

<p>"No; that is, I wonder if you mean Sally Perkins.
She is old enough and ugly enough to answer your
description; and, now I think of it, she <i>has</i> a way of leering
at you as you go by that is slightly suggestive of a
somewhat bitter knowledge of the world. What makes
you ask about her?"</p>

<p>"Because she attracted my attention, I suppose. You
must remember that I don't know any of these people,
and that an especially vicious-looking person like her
would be apt to awaken my curiosity."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>"I see, I see; but, in this case, I doubt if it leads to
much. Old Sally is a hard one, no doubt. But I don't
believe she ever contemplated a murder, much less accomplished
it. It would take too much courage, to say
nothing of strength. It was a man's hand struck that
blow, Mr. Byrd."</p>

<p>"Yes," was the quick reply&mdash;a reply given somewhat
too quickly, perhaps, for it made Mr. Ferris look up inquiringly
at the young man.</p>

<p>"You take considerable interest in the affair," he remarked,
shortly. "Well, I do not wonder. Even my old
blood has been somewhat fired by its peculiar features.
I foresee that your detective instinct will soon lead you to
risk a run at the game."</p>

<p>"Ah, then, you see no objection to my trying for the
scent, if the coroner persists in demanding it?" inquired
Mr. Byrd, as he followed the other to the door.</p>

<p>"On the contrary," was the polite response.</p>

<p>And Mr. Byrd found himself satisfied on that score.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris had no sooner left the room than the coroner
came in.</p>

<p>"Well," cried he, with no unnecessary delay, "I want
you."</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd rose.</p>

<p>"Have you telegraphed to New York?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, and expect an answer every minute. There will
be no difficulty about that. The superintendent is my
friend, and will not be likely to cross me in my expressed
wish."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;" essayed the detective.</p>

<p>"We have no time for buts," broke in the coroner.
"The inquest begins in earnest to-morrow, and the one
witness we most want has not yet been found. I mean
the man or the woman who can swear to seeing some one
approach or enter the murdered woman's house between
the time the milkman left it at half-past eleven and the
hour she was found by Mr. Orcutt, lying upon the floor
of her dining-room in a dying condition. That such a
witness exists I have no doubt. A street in which there
are six houses, every one of which has to be passed by
the person entering Widow Clemmens' gate, must produce
one individual, at least, who can swear to what I
want. To be sure, all whom I have questioned so far say
that they were either eating dinner at the time or were
in the kitchen serving it up; but, for all that, there were
plenty who saw the tramp, and two women, at least, who
are ready to take their oath that they not only saw him,
but watched him long enough to observe him go around
to the Widow Clemmens' kitchen door and turn about
again and come away as if for some reason he had
changed his mind about entering. Now, if there were
two witnesses to see all that, there must have been one
somewhere to notice that other person, known or unknown,
who went through the street but a few minutes before
the tramp. At all events, I believe such a witness can
be found, and I mean to have him if I call up every man,
woman, and child who was in the lane at the time. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
a little foreknowledge helps a coroner wonderfully, and
if you will aid me by making judicious inquiries round
about, time will be gained, and, perhaps, a clue obtained
that will lead to a direct knowledge of the perpetrator
of this crime."</p>

<p>"But," inquired the detective, willing, at least, to discuss
the subject with the coroner, "is it absolutely necessary
that the murderer should have advanced from the
street? Is there no way he could have reached the house
from the back, and so have eluded the gaze of the
neighbors round about?"</p>

<p>"No; that is, there is no regular path there, only a
stretch of swampy ground, any thing but pleasant to travel
through. Of course a man with a deliberate purpose before
him might pursue that route and subject himself to
all its inconveniences; but I would scarcely expect it of
one who&mdash;who chose such an hour for his assault," the
coroner explained, with a slight stammer of embarrassment
that did not escape the detective's notice. "Nor
shall I feel ready to entertain the idea till it has been
proved that no person, with the exception of those already
named, was seen any time during that fatal half-hour to
advance by the usual way to the widow's house."</p>

<p>"Have you questioned the tramp, or in any way received
from him an intimation of the reason why he did
not go into the house after he came to it?"</p>

<p>"He said he heard voices quarrelling."</p>

<p>"Ah!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course he was not upon his oath, but as the statement
was volunteered, we have some right to credit it,
perhaps."</p>

<p>"Did he say"&mdash;it was Mr. Byrd now who lost a trifle
of his fluency&mdash;"what sort of voices he heard?"</p>

<p>"No; he is an ignorant wretch, and is moreover
thoroughly frightened. I don't believe he would know
a cultivated from an uncultivated voice, a gentleman's
from a quarryman's. At all events, we cannot trust to
his discrimination."</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd started. This was the last construction he
had expected to be put upon his question. Flushing a
trifle, he looked the coroner earnestly in the face. But
that gentleman was too absorbed in the train of thought
raised by his own remark to notice the look, and Mr.
Byrd, not feeling any too well assured of his own position,
forbore to utter the words that hovered on his tongue.</p>

<p>"I have another commission for you," resumed the
coroner, after a moment. "Here is a name which I wish
you would look at&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But at this instant a smart tap was heard at the door,
and a boy entered with the expected telegram from New
York. Dr. Tredwell took it, and, after glancing at its
contents with an annoyed look, folded up the paper he
was about to hand to Mr. Byrd and put it slowly back
into his pocket. He then referred again to the
telegram.</p>

<p>"It is not what I expected," he said, shortly, after a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
moment of perplexed thought. "It seems that the superintendent
is not disposed to accommodate me." And he
tossed over the telegram.</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd took it and read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Expect a suitable man by the midnight express. He will bring
a letter."</p></div>

<p>A flush mounted to the detective's brow.</p>

<p>"You see, sir," he observed, "I was right when I told
you I was not the man."</p>

<p>"I don't know," returned the other, rising. "I have
not changed my opinion. The man they send may be
very keen and very well-up in his business, but I doubt
if he will manage this case any better than you would
have done," and he moved quietly toward the door.</p>

<p>"Thank you for your too favorable opinion of my
skill," said Mr. Byrd, as he bowed the other out. "I am
sure the superintendent is right. I am not much accustomed
to work for myself, and was none too eager to take
the case in the first place, as you will do me the justice to
remember. I can but feel relieved at this shifting of the
responsibility upon shoulders more fitted to bear it."</p>

<p>Yet, when the coroner was gone, and he sat down alone
by himself to review the matter, he found he was in reality
more disappointed than he cared to confess. Why,
he scarcely knew. There was no lessening of the shrinking
he had always felt from the possible developments
which an earnest inquiry into the causes of this crime
might educe. Yet, to be severed in this way from all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
professional interest in the pursuit cut him so deeply that,
in despite of his usual good-sense and correct judgment,
he was never nearer sending in his resignation than he
was in that short half-hour which followed the departure
of Dr. Tredwell. To distract his thoughts, he at last
went down to the bar-room.</p>

<h2>VI.</h2>

<h3>THE SKILL OF AN ARTIST.</h3>

<div class='center'>
A hit, a very palpable hit.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hamlet.</span><br />
<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>HE found it occupied by some half-dozen men,
one of whom immediately attracted his attention,
by his high-bred air and total absorption in the
paper he was reading. He was evidently a stranger, and,
though not without some faint marks of a tendency to
gentlemanly dissipation, was, to say the least, more than
ordinarily good-looking, possessing a large, manly figure,
and a fair, regular-featured face, above which shone a
thick crop of short curly hair of a peculiarly bright
blond color. He was sitting at a small table, drawn
somewhat apart from the rest, and was, as I have said,
engrossed with a newspaper, to the utter exclusion of any
apparent interest in the talk that was going on at the
other end of the room. And yet this talk was of the
most animated description, and was seemingly of a nature
to attract the attention of the most indifferent. At all
events Mr. Byrd considered it so; and, after one comprehensive
glance at the elegant stranger, that took in not
only the personal characteristics I have noted, but also
the frown of deep thought or anxious care that furrowed
a naturally smooth forehead, he passed quietly up the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
room and took his stand among the group of loungers
there assembled.</div>

<p>Mr. Byrd was not unknown to the <i>habitu&eacute;s</i> of that
place, and no cessation took place in the conversation.
They were discussing an occurrence slight enough in
itself, but made interesting and dramatic by the unconscious
enthusiasm of the chief speaker, a young fellow of
indifferent personal appearance, but with a fervid flow of
words and a knack at presenting a subject that reminded
you of the actor's power, and made you as anxious to
watch his gesticulations as to hear the words that accompanied
them.</p>

<p>"I tell you," he was saying, "that it was just a leaf out
of a play. I never saw its equal off the stage. She was
so handsome, so impressive in her trouble or anxiety, or
whatever it was that agitated her, and he so dark, and so
determined in <i>his</i> trouble or anxiety, or whatever it was
that agitated him. They came in at different doors, she
at one side of the depot and he at another, and they met
just where I could see them both, directly in the centre
of the room. 'You!' was her involuntary cry, and she
threw up her hands before her face just as if she had seen
a ghost or a demon. An equal exclamation burst from
him, but he did not cover his eyes, only stood and looked
at her as if he were turned to stone. In another moment
she dropped her hands. 'Were you coming to see <i>me?</i>'
came from her lips in a whisper so fraught with secret
horror and anguish that it curdled my blood to hear it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
'Were you coming to see <i>me?</i>' was his response, uttered
in an equally suppressed voice and with an equal intensity
of expression. And then, without either giving an
answer to the other's question, they both shrank back,
and, turning, fled with distracted looks, each by the way
they had come, the two doors closing with a simultaneous
bang that echoed through that miserable depot like a
knell. There were not many folks in the room just at
that minute, but I tell you those that were looked at each
other as they had not done before and would not be
likely to do again. Some unhappy tragedy underlies such
a meeting and parting, gentlemen, and I for one would
rather not inquire what."</p>

<p>"But the girl&mdash;the man&mdash;didn't you see them again
before you left?" asked an eager voice from the group.</p>

<p>"The young lady," remarked the other, "was on the
train that brought me here. The gentleman went the
other way."</p>

<p>"Oh!" "Ah!" and "Where did she get off?" rose
in a somewhat deafening clamor around him.</p>

<p>"I did not observe. She seemed greatly distressed, if
not thoroughly overcome, and observing her pull down
her veil, I thought she did not relish my inquiring looks,
and as I could not sit within view of her and not watch
her, I discreetly betook myself into the smoking-car,
where I stayed till we arrived at this place."</p>

<p>"Hum!" "Ha!" "Curious!" rose in chorus once
more, and then, the general sympathies of the crowd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
being exhausted, two or three or more of the group
sauntered up to the bar, and the rest sidled restlessly out
of the room, leaving the enthusiastic speaker alone with
Mr. Byrd.</p>

<p>"A strange scene!" exclaimed the latter, infusing just
enough of seeming interest into his usually nonchalant
tone to excite the vanity of the person he addressed, and
make him more than ever ready to talk. "I wish I had
been in your place," continued Mr. Byrd, almost enthusiastically.
"I am sure I could have made a picture of
that scene that would have been very telling in the
gazette I draw for."</p>

<p>"Do you make pictures for papers?" the young fellow
inquired, his respect visibly rising.</p>

<p>"Sometimes," the imperturbable detective replied, and
in so doing told no more than the truth. He had a rare
talent for off-hand sketching, and not infrequently made
use of it to increase the funds of the family.</p>

<p>"Well, that is something I would like to do," acknowledged
the youth, surveying the other over with curious
eyes. "But I hav'n't a cent's worth of talent for it. I
can see a scene in my mind now&mdash;this one for instance&mdash;just
as plain as I can see you; all the details of it, you
know, the way they stood, the clothes they wore, the looks
on their faces, and all that, but when I try to put it on
paper, why, I just can't, that's all."</p>

<p>"Your forte lies another way," remarked Mr. Byrd.
"You can present a scene so vividly that a person who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
had not seen it for himself, might easily put it on paper
just from your description. See now!" And he caught
up a sheet of paper from the desk and carried it to a side
table. "Just tell me what depot this was in."</p>

<p>The young fellow, greatly interested at once, leaned
over the detective's shoulder and eagerly replied: "The
depot at Syracuse."</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd nodded and made a few strokes with his
pencil on the paper before him.</p>

<p>"How was the lady dressed?" he next asked.</p>

<p>"In blue; dark blue cloth, fitting like a glove. Fine
figure, you know, very tall and unusually large, but perfect,
I assure you, perfect. Yes, that is very like it," he
went on watching the quick, assured strokes of the other
with growing wonder and an unbounded admiration.
"You have caught the exact poise of the head, as I live,
and&mdash;yes, a large hat with two feathers, sir, two feathers
drooping over the side, so; a bag on the arm; two flounces
on the skirt; a&mdash;oh! the face? Well, handsome,
sir, very handsome; straight nose, large eyes, determined
mouth, strong, violently agitated expression. Well, I will
give up! A photograph couldn't have done her better
justice. You are a genius, sir, a genius!"</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd received this tribute to his skill with some
confusion and a deep blush, which he vainly sought to
hide by bending lower over his work.</p>

<p>"The man, now," he suggested, with the least perceptible
change in his voice, that, however, escaped the attention<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
of his companion. "What was he like; young or
old?"</p>

<p>"Well, young&mdash;about twenty-five I should say; medium
height, but very firmly and squarely built, with a
strong face, large mustache, brilliant eyes, and a look&mdash;I
cannot describe it, but you have caught that of the lady
so well, you will, doubtless, succeed in getting his also."</p>

<p>But Mr. Byrd's pencil moved with less certainty now,
and it was some time before he could catch even the peculiarly
sturdy aspect of the figure which made this unknown
gentleman, as the young fellow declared, look like
a modern Hercules, though he was far from being either
large or tall. The face, too, presented difficulties he was
far from experiencing in the case of the lady, and the
young fellow at his side was obliged to make several suggestions
such as:&mdash;"A little more hair on the forehead, if
you please&mdash;there was quite a lock showing beneath his
hat;" or, "A trifle less sharpness to the chin,&mdash;so;" or,
"Stay, you have it too square now; tone it down a hair's
breadth, and you will get it," before he received even the
somewhat hesitating acknowledgment from the other of:
"There, that is something like him!"</p>

<p>But he had not expected to succeed very well in this
part of the picture, and was sufficiently pleased to have
gained a very correct notion of the style of clothing the
gentleman wore, which, it is needless to state, was most
faithfully reproduced in the sketch, even if the exact
expression of the strong and masculine face was not.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>"A really remarkable bit of work," admitted the young
fellow when the whole was completed. "And as true to
the scene, too, as half the illustrations given in the weekly
papers. Would you mind letting me have it as a <i>souvenir?</i>"
he eagerly inquired. "I would like to show it to
a chap who was with me at the time. The likeness to the
lady is wonderful."</p>

<p>But Mr. Byrd, with his most careless air, had already
thrust the picture into his pocket, from which he refused
to withdraw it, saying, with an easy laugh, that it might
come in play with him some time, and that he could not
afford to part with it. At which remark the young fellow
looked disappointed and vaguely rattled some coins he
had in his pocket; but, meeting with no encouragement
from the other, forbore to press his request, and turned it
into an invitation to join him in a social glass at the bar.</p>

<p>To this slight token of appreciation Mr. Byrd did not
choose to turn a deaf ear. So the drinks being ordered,
he proceeded to clink glasses with the youthful stranger,
taking the opportunity, at the same time, of glancing over
to the large, well-built man whose quiet absorption in the
paper he was reading had so attracted his attention when
he first came in.</p>

<p>To his surprise he found that person just as engrossed
in the news as ever, not a feature or an eyelash appearing
to have moved since the time he looked at him last.</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd was so astonished at this that when he left
the room a few minutes later he took occasion in passing
the gentleman, to glance at the paper he was studying so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
industriously, and, to his surprise, found it to be nothing
more nor less than the advertising sheet of the New York
<i>Herald</i>.</p>

<p>"A fellow of my own craft," was his instantaneous conclusion.
But a moment's consideration assured him that
this could not be, as no detective worthy the name would
place so little value upon the understanding of those
about him as to sit for a half-hour with his eyes upon a
sheet of paper totally devoid of news, no matter what his
purpose might be, or how great was his interest in the conversation
to which he was secretly listening. No; this gentleman
was doubtless what he seemed to be, a mere stranger,
with something of a serious and engrossing nature
upon his mind, or else he was an amateur, who for some
reason was acting the part of a detective without either
the skill or experience of one.</p>

<p>Whichever theory might be true, this gentleman was a
person who at this time and in this place was well worth
watching: that is, if a man had any reason for interesting
himself in the pursuit of possible clues to the mystery
of Mrs. Clemmens' murder. But Mr. Byrd felt that he
no longer possessed a professional right to such interest;
so, leaving behind him this fine-looking gentleman,
together with all the inevitable conjectures which the
latter's peculiar manner had irresistibly awakened, he
proceeded to regain his room and enter upon that contemplation
of the picture he had just made, which was
naturally demanded by his regard for one of the persons
there depicted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a vigorous sketch, and the slow blush crept up
and dyed Mr. Byrd's forehead as he gazed at it and realized
the perfection of the likeness he had drawn of Miss
Dare. Yes, that was her form, her face, her expression,
her very self. She it was and no other who had been the
heroine of the strange scene enacted that day in the
Syracuse depot; a scene to which, by means of this impromptu
sketch, he had now become as nearly a witness
as any one could hope for who had not been actually upon
the spot. Strange! And he had been so anxious to
know what had altered the mind of this lady and sent her
back to Sibley before her journey was half completed&mdash;had
pondered so long and vainly upon the whys and
wherefores of an action whose motive he had never expected
to understand, but which he now saw suggested in
a scene that seriously whetted, if it did not thoroughly
satisfy, his curiosity.</p>

<p>The moment he had chosen to portray was that in
which the eyes of the two met and their first instinctive
recoil took place. Turning his attention from the face
of the lady and bestowing it upon that of the man, he
perceived there the horror and shrinking which he had
imprinted so successfully upon hers. That the expression
was true, though the countenance was not, he had no
doubt. The man, whatever his name, nature, calling, or
history, recoiled from a meeting with Imogene Dare as
passionately as she did from one with him. Both had
started from home with a simultaneous intention of seeking
the other, and yet, at the first recognition of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
fact, both had started and drawn back as if death rather
than life had confronted them in each other's faces.
What did it mean? What secret of a deep and deadly
nature could lie between these two, that a scene of such
evident import could take place between them? He
dared not think; he could do nothing but gaze upon the
figure of the man he had portrayed, and wonder if he
would be able to identify the original in case he ever met
him. The face was more or less a failure, of course, but
the form, the cut of the clothes, the manner of carriage,
and the general aspect of strong and puissant manhood
which distinguished the whole figure, could not be so far
from correct but that, with a hint from surrounding circumstances,
he would know the man himself when he saw
him. At all events, he meant to imprint the possible
portrait upon his mind in case&mdash;&mdash;in case what? Pausing
he asked himself this question with stern determination,
and could find no answer.</p>

<p>"I will burn the sketch at once, and think of it and her
no more," he muttered, half-rising.</p>

<p>But he did not do it. Some remembrance crossed his
mind of what the young fellow downstairs had said about
retaining it as a <i>souvenir</i>, and he ended in folding it up
and putting it away somewhat carefully in his memorandum-book,
with a vow that he would leave Sibley and its
troublous mystery at the first moment of release that he
could possibly obtain. The pang which this decision cost
him convinced him that it was indeed high time he
did so.</p>

<h2>VII.</h2>

<h3>MISS FIRMAN.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I confess with all humility that at times the line of demarcation between
truth and fiction is rendered so indefinite and indistinct, that I cannot always
determine, with unerring certainty, whether an event really happened to me,
or whether <i>I</i> only dreamed it.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Longfellow.</span></p><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>MR. BYRD, upon waking next morning, found
himself disturbed by a great perplexity. Were
the words then ringing in his ears, real words, which he
had overheard spoken outside of his door some time during
the past night, or were they merely the empty utterances
of a more than usually vivid dream?</div>

<p>He could not tell. He could remember the very tone
of voice in which he fancied them to have been spoken&mdash;a
tone which he had no difficulty in recognizing as that
of the landlord of the hotel; could even recall the faint
sounds of bustle which accompanied them, as though the
person using them had been showing another person
through the hall; but beyond that, all was indistinct and
dream-like.</p>

<p>The words were these:</p>

<p>"Glad to see you back, sir. This murder following so
close upon your visit must have been a great surprise. A
sad occurrence, that, sir, and a very mysterious one.
Hope you have some information to give."</p>

<p>"If it is a remembrance and such words were uttered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
outside of my door last night," argued the young detective
to himself, "the guest who called them forth can be
no other than the tall and florid gentleman whom I encountered
in the bar-room. But is it a remembrance, or
only a chimera of my own overwrought brain struggling
with a subject it will not let drop? As Shakespeare
says, 'That is the question!'"</p>

<p>Fortunately, it was not one which it behooved him to
decide. So, for the twentieth time, he put the subject by
and resolved to think of it no more.</p>

<p>But perplexities of this kind are not so easily dismissed,
and more than once during his hurried and solitary breakfast,
did he ask himself whether, in case the words were
real, he had not found in the landlord of this very hotel
the one witness for which the coroner was so diligently
seeking.</p>

<p>A surprise awaited him after breakfast, in the sudden
appearance at his room door of the very gentleman last
alluded to.</p>

<p>"Ha, Byrd," said he, with cheerful vivacity: "here is a
line from the superintendent which may prove interesting
to you."</p>

<p>And with a complacent smile, Dr. Tredwell handed
over a letter which had been brought to him by the
detective who had that morning arrived from New York.</p>

<p>With a dim sense of foreboding which he would have
found difficult to explain, Mr. Byrd opened the note
and read the following words:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I send with this a man fully competent to conduct a
case of any ordinary difficulty. I acknowledge it is for our interest
that you employ him to the exclusion of the person mentioned in your
letter. But if you or that person think that he can render you any
real assistance by his interference, he is at liberty to act in his
capacity of detective in as far as he can do so without divulging too
widely the secret of his connection with the force.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;.</p></div>

<p>"The superintendent need not be concerned," said Mr.
Byrd, returning the note with a constrained bow. "I
shall not interfere in this matter."</p>

<p>"You will miss a good thing, then," remarked the
coroner, shortly, looking keenly at the young man.</p>

<p>"I cannot help it," observed the other, with a quick
sigh of impatience or regret. "I should have to see my
duty very clearly and possess the very strongest reasons
for interfering before I presumed to offer either advice or
assistance after a letter of this kind."</p>

<p>"And who knows but what such reasons may yet present
themselves?" ventured the coroner. Then seeing
the young man shake his head, made haste to add in the
business-like tone of one preparing to take his leave,
"At all events the matter stands open for the present;
and if during the course of to-day's inquiry you see fit
to change your mind, it will be easy enough for you to
notify me." And without waiting for any further remonstrance,
he gave a quick nod and passed hastily out.</p>

<p>The state of mind in which he left Mr. Byrd was any
thing but enviable. Not that the young man's former
determination to let this matter alone had been in any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
wise shaken by the unexpected concession on the part of
the superintendent, but that the final hint concerning the
inquest had aroused his old interest to quite a formidable
degree, and, what was worse, had reawakened certain
feelings which since last night it had been his most
earnest endeavor to subdue. He felt like a man pursued
by an implacable fate, and dimly wondered whether he
would be allowed to escape before it was too late to save
himself from lasting uneasiness, if not lifelong regret.</p>

<p>A final stroke of business for Mr. Ferris kept him at
the court-house most of the morning; but his duty in
that direction being at an end, he no longer found any
excuse for neglecting the task imposed upon him by the
coroner. He accordingly proceeded to the cottage where
the inquest was being held, and finding each and every
available room there packed to its uttermost by interested
spectators, took up his stand on the outside of a curtained
window, where with but a slight craning of his neck he
could catch a very satisfactory view of the different witnesses
as they appeared before the jury. The day was
warm and he was by no means uncomfortable, though he
could have wished that the advantages of his position had
occasioned less envy in the breasts of the impatient crowd
that was slowly gathering at his back; or, rather, that
their sense of these advantages might have been expressed
in some more pleasing way than by the various pushes he
received from the more or less adventurous spirits who
endeavored to raise themselves over his shoulder or insinuate
themselves under his arms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>The room into which he looked was the sitting-room,
and it was, so far as he could judge in the first casual
glance he threw into it, occupied entirely by strangers.
This was a relief. Since it had become his duty to
attend this inquiry, he wished to do so with a free mind,
unhindered by the watchfulness of those who knew his
interest in the affair, or by the presence of persons around
whom his own imagination had involuntarily woven a network
of suspicion that made his observation of them at
once significant and painful.</p>

<p>The proceedings were at a standstill when he first came
upon the scene.</p>

<p>A witness had just stepped aside, who, from the impatient
shrugs of many persons present, had evidently added
little if any thing to the testimony already given. Taking
advantage of the moment, Mr. Byrd leaned forward and
addressed a burly man who sat directly under him.</p>

<p>"What have they been doing all the morning?" he
asked. "Any thing important?"</p>

<p>"No," was the surly reply. "A score of folks have
had their say, but not one of them has told any thing
worth listening to. Nobody has seen any thing, nobody
knows any thing. The murderer might have risen up
through the floor to deal his blow, and having given it,
sunk back again with the same supernatural claptrap, for
all these stupid people seem to know about him."</p>

<p>The man had a loud voice, and as he made no attempt
to modulate it, his words were heard on all sides. Naturally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
many heads were turned toward him, and more than
one person looked at him with an amused smile. Indeed,
of all the various individuals in his immediate vicinity,
only one forbore to take any notice of his remark. This
was a heavy, lymphatic, and somewhat abstracted-looking
fellow of nondescript appearance, who stood stiff and
straight as an exclamation point against the jamb of the
door-way that led into the front hall.</p>

<p>"But have no facts been obtained, no conclusions
reached, that would serve to awaken suspicion or put
justice on the right track?" pursued Mr. Byrd, lowering
his voice in intimation for the other to do the same.</p>

<p>But that other was of an obstinate tendency, and his
reply rose full and loud.</p>

<p>"No, unless it can be considered proved that it is only
folly to try and find out who commits a crime in these
days. Nothing else has come to light, as far as I can see,
and that much we all knew before."</p>

<p>A remark of this kind was not calculated to allay the
slight inclination to mirth which his former observation
had raised; but the coroner rapping with his gavel on
the table at this moment, every other consideration was
lost in the natural curiosity which every one felt as to who
the next witness would be.</p>

<p>But the coroner had something to say before he called
for further testimony.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he remarked, in a clear and commanding
tone that at once secured attention and awakened interest,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
"we have spent the morning in examining the persons
who live in this street, with a view to ascertaining,
if possible, who was in conversation with Mrs. Clemmens
at the time the tramp went up to her door."</p>

<p>Was it a coincidence, or was there something in the
words themselves that called forth the stir that at this
moment took place among the people assembled directly
before Mr. Byrd? It was of the slightest character, and
was merely momentary in its duration; nevertheless, it
attracted his attention, especially as it seemed to have its
origin in a portion of the room shut off from his observation
by the corner of the wall already alluded to.</p>

<p>The coroner proceeded without pause.</p>

<p>"The result, as you know, has not been satisfactory.
No one seems to be able to tell us who it was that visited
Mrs. Clemmens on that day. I now propose to open
another examination of a totally different character,
which I hope may be more conclusive in its results.
Miss Firman, are you prepared to give your testimony?"</p>

<p>Immediately a tall, gaunt, but pleasant-faced woman
arose from the dim recesses of the parlor. She was
dressed with decency, if not taste, and took her stand
before the jury with a lady-like yet perfectly assured
air that promised well for the correctness and discretion
of her answers. The coroner at once addressed her.</p>

<p>"Your full name, madam?"</p>

<p>"Emily Letitia Firman, sir."</p>

<p>"Emily!" ejaculated Mr. Byrd, to himself, with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
throb of sudden interest. "That is the name of the
murdered woman's correspondent."</p>

<p>"Your birthplace," pursued the coroner, "and the
place of your present residence?"</p>

<p>"I was born in Danbury, Connecticut," was the reply,
"and I am living in Utica, where I support my aged
mother by dress-making."</p>

<p>"How are you related to Mrs. Clemmens, the lady who
was found murdered here two days ago?"</p>

<p>"I am her second cousin; her grandmother and my
mother were sisters."</p>

<p>"Upon what terms have you always lived, and what
can you tell us of her other relatives and connections?"</p>

<p>"We have always been friends, and I can tell you all
that is generally known of the two or three remaining
persons of her blood and kindred. They are, first, my
mother and myself, who, as I have before said, live in
Utica, where I am connected with the dress-making
establishment of Madame Trebelle; and, secondly, a
nephew of hers, the son of a favorite brother, whom she
has always supported, and to whom she has frequently
avowed her intention of leaving her accumulated savings."</p>

<p>"The name of this gentleman and his place of residence?"</p>

<p>"His name is Mansell&mdash;Craik Mansell&mdash;and he lives
in Buffalo, where he has a situation of some trust in the
large paper manufactory of Harrison, Goodman, &amp;
Chamberlin."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Buffalo! Mr. Byrd gave an involuntary start, and became,
if possible, doubly attentive.</p>

<p>The coroner's questions went on.</p>

<p>"Do you know this young man?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. He has been several times to our house in
the course of the last five years."</p>

<p>"What can you tell us of his nature and disposition,
as well as of his regard for the woman who proposed to
benefit him so materially by her will?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir," returned Miss Firman, "it is hard to read
the nature and feelings of any man who has much character,
and Craik Mansell has a good deal of character.
But I have always thought him a very honest and capable
young man, who might do us credit some day, if he were
allowed to have his own way and not be interfered with
too much. As for his feelings toward his aunt, they were
doubtless those of gratitude, though I have never heard
him express himself in any very affectionate terms toward
her, owing, no doubt, to a natural reticence of disposition
which has been observable in him from childhood."</p>

<p>"You have, however, no reason to believe he cherished
any feelings of animosity toward his benefactress?" continued
the coroner, somewhat carelessly, "or possessed
any inordinate desire after the money she was expecting
to leave him at her death?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. Both having minds of their own, they frequently
disagreed, especially on business matters; but
there was never any bitterness between them, as far as I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
know, and I never heard him say any thing about his expectations
one way or the other. He is a man of much
natural force, of strong, if not violent, traits of character;
but he has too keen a sense of his own dignity to intimate
the existence of desires so discreditable to him."</p>

<p>There was something in this reply and the impartial
aspect of the lady delivering it that was worthy of notice,
perhaps. And such it would have undoubtedly received
from Mr. Byrd, at least, if the words she had used in
characterizing this person had not struck him so deeply
that he forgot to note any thing further.</p>

<p>"A man of great natural force&mdash;of strong, if not
violent traits of character," he kept repeating to himself.
"The description, as I live, of the person whose picture I
attempted to draw last night."</p>

<p>And, ignoring every thing else, he waited with almost
sickening expectation for the question that would link
this nephew of Mrs. Clemmens either to the tragedy
itself, or to that person still in the background, of whose
secret connection with a man of this type, he had
obtained so curious and accidental a knowledge.</p>

<p>But it did not come. With a quiet abandonment of the
by no means exhausted topic, which convinced Mr. Byrd
that the coroner had plans and suspicions to which
the foregoing questions had given no clue, Dr. Tredwell
leaned slowly forward, and, after surveying the witness
with a glance of cautious inquiry, asked in a way to concentrate
the attention of all present:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"You say that you knew the Widow Clemmens well;
that you have always been on friendly terms with her,
and are acquainted with her affairs. Does that mean you
have been made a confidante of her troubles, her responsibilities,
and her cares?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; that is, in as far as she ever made a confidant
of any one. Mrs. Clemmens was not of a complaining
disposition, neither was she by nature very communicative.
Only at rare times did she make mention of
herself or her troubles: but when she did, it was invariably
to me, sir&mdash;or so she used to say; and she was
not a woman to deceive you in such matters."</p>

<p>"Very well, then, you are in a position to tell us something
of her history, and why it is she kept herself so
close after she came to this town?"</p>

<p>But Miss Firman uttered a vigorous disclaimer to this.
"No, sir," said she, "I am not. Mrs. Clemmens' history
was simple enough, but her reasons for living as she did
have never been explained. She was not naturally a
quiet woman, and, when a girl, was remarkable for
her spirits and fondness for company."</p>

<p>"Has she had any great sorrow since you knew her&mdash;any
serious loss or disappointment that may have soured
her disposition, and turned her, as it were, against
the world?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps; she felt the death of her husband very
much&mdash;indeed, has never been quite the same since
she lost him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>"And when was that, if you please?"</p>

<p>"Full fifteen years ago, sir; just before she came
to this town."</p>

<p>"Did you know Mr. Clemmens?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; none of us knew him. They were married in
some small village out West, where he died&mdash;well, I think
she wrote&mdash;a month if not less after their marriage. She
was inconsolable for a time, and, though she consented to
come East, refused to take up her abode with any of
her relatives, and so settled in this place, where she
has remained ever since."</p>

<p>The manner of the coroner suddenly changed to one of
great impressiveness.</p>

<p>"Miss Firman," he now asked, "did it ever strike you
that the hermit life she led was due to any fear or apprehension
which she may have secretly entertained?"</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>The question was peculiar and no one wondered at the
start which the good woman gave. But what mainly
struck Mr. Byrd, and gave to the moment a seeming
importance, was the fact that she was not alone in her
surprise or even her expression of it; that the indefinable
stir he had before observed had again taken place in the
crowd before him, and that this time there was no doubt
about its having been occasioned by the movements of a
person whose elbow he could just perceive projecting
beyond the door-way that led into the hall.</p>

<p>But there was no time for speculation as to whom this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
person might be. The coroner's questions were every
moment growing more rapid, and Miss Firman's answers
more interesting.</p>

<p>"I asked," here the coroner was heard to say, "whether,
in your intercourse with Mrs. Clemmens, you have ever
had reason to suppose she was the victim of any secret
or personal apprehension that might have caused her
to seclude herself as she did? Or let me put it in another
way. Can you tell me whether you know of any other
person besides this nephew of hers who is likely to
be benefited by Mrs. Clemmens' death?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," was the hasty and somewhat excited reply,
"you mean young Mr. Hildreth!"</p>

<p>The way in which this was said, together with the
slight flush of satisfaction or surprise which rose to the
coroner's brow, naturally awoke the slumbering excitement
of the crowd and made a small sensation. A low
murmur ran through the rooms, amid which Mr. Byrd
thought he heard a suppressed but bitter exclamation.
He could not be sure of it, however, and had just made
up his mind that his ears had deceived him, when his
attention was attracted by a shifting in the position of
the sturdy, thick-set man who had been leaning against
the opposite wall, but who now crossed and took his stand
beside the jamb, on the other side of which sat the unknown
individual toward whom so many inquiring
glances had hitherto been directed.</p>

<p>The quietness with which this change was made, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
the slight, almost imperceptible, alteration in the manner
of the person making it, brought a sudden enlightenment
to Mr. Byrd, and he at once made up his mind that this
dull, abstracted-looking nonentity leaning with such apparent
unconcern against the wall, was the new detective
who had been sent up that morning from New York.
His curiosity in regard to the identity of the individual
round the corner was not lessened by this.</p>

<p>Meantime the coroner had answered the hasty exclamation
of the witness, by disclaiming the existence of
any special meaning of his own, and had furthermore
pressed the question as to who this Mr. Hildreth was.</p>

<p>She immediately answered: "A gentleman of Toledo,
sir; a young man who could only come into his property
by the death of Mrs. Clemmens."</p>

<p>"How? You have not spoken of any such person as
connected with her."</p>

<p>"No," was her steady response; "nor was he so connected
by any tie of family or friendship. Indeed, I do
not know as they were ever acquainted, or, as for that
matter, ever saw each other's faces. The fact to which I
allude was simply the result of a will, sir, made by Mr.
Hildreth's grandfather."</p>

<p>"A will? Explain yourself. I do not understand."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I do not know much about the law, and
may make a dozen mistakes in telling you what you wish
to know; but what I understand about the matter is this:
Mr. Hildreth, the grandfather of the gentleman of whom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
I have just spoken, having a large property, which he
wanted to leave in bulk to his grandchildren,&mdash;their
father being a very dissipated and reckless man,&mdash;made
his will in such a way as to prevent its distribution
among his heirs till after the death of two persons whom
he mentioned by name. Of these two persons one was
the son of his head clerk, a young boy, who sickened and
died shortly after Mr. Hildreth himself, and the other my
cousin, the poor murdered woman, who was then a little
girl visiting the family. I do not know how she came to
be chosen by him for this purpose, unless it was that she
was particularly round and ruddy as a child, and looked
as if she might live for many years."</p>

<p>"And the Hildreths? What of them during these
years?"</p>

<p>"Well, I cannot exactly say, as I never had any acquaintance
with them myself. But I know that the
father, whose dissipated habits were the cause of this
peculiar will tying up the property, died some little time
ago; also one or two of his children, but beyond that I
know little, except that the remaining heirs are a young
gentleman and one or two young girls, all of the worldliest
and most fashionable description."</p>

<p>The coroner, who had followed all this with the greatest
interest, now asked if she knew the first name of the
young gentleman.</p>

<p>"Yes," said she, "I do. It is Gouverneur."</p>

<p>The coroner gave a satisfied nod, and remarked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
casually, "It is not a common name," and then, leaning
forward, selected a paper from among several that lay on
the table before him. "Miss Firman," he inquired, retaining
this paper in his hand, "do you know when it
was that Mrs. Clemmens first became acquainted with
the fact of her name having been made use of in the
elder Mr. Hildreth's will?"</p>

<p>"Oh, years ago; when she first came of age, I believe."</p>

<p>"Was it an occasion of regret to her? Did she ever
express herself as sorry for the position in which she
stood toward this family?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; she did."</p>

<p>The coroner's face assumed a yet greater gravity, and
his manner became more and more impressive.</p>

<p>"Can you go a step farther and say that she ever
acknowledged herself to have cherished apprehensions
of her personal safety, during these years of weary waiting
on the part of the naturally impatient heirs?"</p>

<p>A distressed look crossed the amiable spinster's face,
and she looked around at the jury with an expression
almost deprecatory in its nature.</p>

<p>"I scarcely know what answer to give," she hesitatingly
declared. "It is a good deal to say that she was apprehensive;
but I cannot help remembering that she once
told me her peace of mind had left her since she knew
there were persons in the world to whom her death would
be a matter of rejoicing. 'It makes me feel as if I were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
keeping people out of their rights,' she remarked at the
same time. 'And, though it is not my fault, I should
not be surprised if some day I had to suffer for it.'"</p>

<p>"Was there ever any communication made to Mrs.
Clemmens by persons cognizant of the relation in which
she stood to these Hildreths?&mdash;or any facts or gossip
detailed to her concerning them, that would seem to give
color to her fears and supply her with any actual grounds
for her apprehensions?"</p>

<p>"No; only such tales as came to her of their expensive
ways of living and somewhat headlong rush into all
fashionable freaks and follies."</p>

<p>"And Gouverneur Hildreth? Any special gossip in
regard to him?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>There are some noes that are equivalent to affirmations.
This was one of them. Naturally the coroner
pressed the question.</p>

<p>"I must request you to think again," he persisted.
Then, with a change of voice: "Are you sure you have
never heard any thing specially derogatory to this young
man, or that Mrs. Clemmens had not?"</p>

<p>"I have friends in Toledo who speak of him as the
fastest man about town, if that could be called derogatory.
As for Mrs. Clemmens, she may have heard as
much, and she may have heard more, I cannot say. I
know she always frowned when his father's name was
mentioned."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>"Miss Firman," proceeded the coroner, "in the long
years in which you have been more or less separated
from Mrs. Clemmens, you have, doubtless, kept up a
continued if not frequent correspondence with her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Do you think, from the commencement and general
tone of this letter, which I found lying half finished
on her desk, that it was written and intended for yourself?"</p>

<p>Taking the letter from his outstretched hand, she
fumbled nervously for her glasses, put them on, and
then glanced hurriedly at the sheet, saying as she did
so:</p>

<p>"There can be no doubt of it. She had no other
friend whom she would have been likely to address as
'Dear Emily.'"</p>

<p>"Gentlemen of the Jury, you have a right to hear the
words written by the deceased but a few hours, if not a
few minutes, previous to the brutal assault that has led to
the present inquiry. Miss Firman, as the letter was intended
for yourself, will you be kind enough to read it
aloud, after which you will hand it over to the jury."</p>

<p>With a gloomy shake of her head, and a certain trembling
in her voice, that was due, perhaps, as much to
the sadness of her task as to any foreboding of the real
nature of the words she had to read, she proceeded to
comply:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Emily</span>:&mdash;I don't know why I sit down to write to you
to-day. I have plenty to do, and morning is no time for indulging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
in sentimentalities. But I feel strangely lonely and strangely anxious.
Nothing goes just to my mind, and somehow the many causes for
secret fear which I have always had, assume an undue prominence in
my mind. It is always so when I am not quite well. In vain I
reason with myself, saying that respectable people do not lightly
enter into crime. But there are so many to whom my death would
be more than welcome, that I constantly see myself in the act of
being&mdash;&mdash;</p></div>

<p>"Good heavens!" ejaculated the spinster, dropping
the paper from her hand and looking dismally around
upon the assembled faces of the now deeply interested
spectators.</p>

<p>Seeing her dismay, a man who stood at the right of the
coroner, and who seemed to be an officer of the law,
quietly advanced, and picking up the paper she had let
fall, handed it to the jury. The coroner meanwhile
recalled her attention to herself.</p>

<p>"Miss Firman," said he, "allow me to put to you one
final question which, though it might not be called a
strictly legal one, is surely justified by the gravity of the
situation. If Mrs. Clemmens had finished this letter, and
you in due course had received it, what conclusion
would you have drawn from the words you have just
read?"</p>

<p>"I could have drawn but one, sir. I should have considered
that the solitary life led by my cousin was telling
upon her mind."</p>

<p>"But these terrors of which she speaks? To what and
whom would you have attributed them?"</p>

<p>"I don't like to say it, and I don't know as I am<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
justified in saying it, but it would have been impossible
for me, under the circumstances, to have thought of any
other source for them than the one we have already
mentioned."</p>

<p>"And that is?" inexorably pursued the coroner.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gouverneur Hildreth."</p>

<h2>VIII.</h2>

<h3>THE THICK-SET MAN.</h3>

<div class='center'>
Springs to catch woodcocks.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hamlet.</span><br />
<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>IN the pause that followed, Miss Firman stepped
aside, and Mr. Byrd, finding his attention released,
stole a glance toward the hall-way and its nearly concealed
occupant. He found the elbow in agitated movement,
and, as he looked at it, saw it disappear and a hand
project into view, groping for the handkerchief which was,
doubtless, hidden in the hat which he now perceived
standing on the floor in the corner of the door-way. He
looked at that hand well. It was large, white, and
elegantly formed, and wore a seal ring of conspicuous
size upon the little finger. He had scarcely noticed this
ring, and wondered if others had seen it too, when the
hand plunged into the hat, and drawing out the kerchief,
vanished with it behind the jamb that had already hidden
so much from his view.</div>

<p>"A fine gentleman's hand, and a fine gentleman's ring,"
was Mr. Byrd's mental comment; and he was about
to glance aside, when, to his great astonishment, he saw
the hand appear once more with the handkerchief in it,
but without the ring which a moment since had made it
such a conspicuous mark for his eyes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"Our fine gentleman is becoming frightened," he
thought, watching the hand until it dropped the handkerchief
back into the hat. "One does not take off a ring in
a company like this without a good reason." And
he threw a quick glance at the man he considered his
rival in the detective business.</p>

<p>But that worthy was busily engaged in stroking his chin
in a feeling way, strongly suggestive of a Fledgerby-like
interest in his absent whisker; and well versed as
was Mr. Byrd in the ways of his fellow-detectives, he
found it impossible to tell whether the significant action
he had just remarked had escaped the attention of
this man or not. Confused if not confounded, he turned
back to the coroner, in a maze of new sensations, among
which a growing hope that his own former suspicions had
been of a wholly presumptuous character, rose predominant.</p>

<p>He found that functionary preparing to make a remark.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said he; "you have listened to the
testimony of Mrs. Clemmens' most confidential friend,
and heard such explanations as she had to give, of
the special fears which Mrs. Clemmens acknowledges herself
to have entertained in regard to her personal safety.
Now, while duly impressing upon you the necessity of not
laying too much stress upon the secret apprehensions of
a woman living a life of loneliness and seclusion, I still
consider it my duty to lay before you another bit of the
widow's writing, in which&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Here he was interrupted by the appearance at his side
of a man with a telegram in his hand. In the pause
which followed his reading of the same, Mr. Byrd, with
that sudden impulse of interference which comes upon us
all at certain junctures, tore out a leaf from his memorandum-book,
and wrote upon it some half dozen or
so words indicative of the advisability of examining the
proprietor of the Eastern Hotel as to the name and
quality of the several guests entertained by him on the
day of the murder; and having signed this communication
with his initial letters H. B., looked about for a
messenger to carry it to the coroner. He found one in
the person of a small boy, who was pressing with all his
might against his back, and having despatched him with
the note, regained his old position at the window, and
proceeded to watch, with a growing interest in the drama
before him, the result of his interference upon the
coroner.</p>

<p>He had not long to wait. The boy had no sooner
shown himself at the door with the note, than Dr.
Tredwell laid down the telegram he was perusing and
took this new communication. With a slight smile Mr.
Byrd was not slow in attributing to its true source,
he read the note through, then turned to the officer
at his side and gave him some command that sent him
from the room. He then took up the slip he was on the
point of presenting to the jury at the time he was
first interrupted, and continuing his remarks in reference
to it, said quietly:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gentlemen, this paper which I here pass over to you,
was found by me in the recess of Mrs. Clemmens' desk at
the time I examined it for the address of Miss Firman.
It was in an envelope that had never been sealed, and
was, if I may use the expression, tucked away under a pile
of old receipts. The writing is similar to that used
in the letter you have just read, and the signature attached
to it is 'Mary Ann Clemmens.' Will Mr. Black
of the jury read aloud the words he will there find
written?"</p>

<p>Mr. Black, in whose hand the paper then rested,
looked up with a flush, and slowly, if not painfully, complied:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I desire"&mdash;such was the language of the writing before him&mdash;"that
in case of any sudden or violent death on my part, the authorities
should inquire into the possible culpability of a gentleman living
in Toledo, Ohio, known by the name of Gouverneur Hildreth. He is
a man of no principle, and my distinct conviction is, that if such a
death should occur to me, it will be entirely due to his efforts to gain
possession of property which cannot be at his full disposal until my
death.</p>

<div class='sig'>
"<span class="smcap">Mary Ann Clemmens</span>, Sibley, N. Y."<br />
</div></div>

<p>"A serious charge!" quoth a juryman, breaking the
universal silence occasioned by this communication from
the dead.</p>

<p>"I should think so," echoed the burly man in front of
Mr. Byrd.</p>

<p>But Mr. Byrd himself and the quiet man who leaned so
stiffly and abstractedly against the wall, said nothing. Perhaps
they found themselves sufficiently engaged in watching<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
that half-seen elbow, which since the reading of this
last slip of paper had ceased all movement and remained
as stationary as though it had been paralyzed.</p>

<p>"A charge which, as yet, is nothing but a charge," observed
the coroner. "But evidence is not wanting," he
went on, "that Mr. Hildreth is not at home at this present
time, but is somewhere in this region, as will be seen
by the following telegram from the superintendent of the
Toledo police." And he held up to view, not the telegram
he had just received, but another which he had
taken from among the papers on the table before him:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Party mentioned not in Toledo. Left for the East on midnight
train of Wednesday the 27th inst. When last heard from was in Albany.
He has been living fast, and is well known to be in pecuniary
difficulties, necessitating a large and immediate amount of money.
Further particulars by letter.</p></div>

<p>"That, gentlemen, I received last night. To-day,"
he continued, taking up the telegram that had just come
in, "the following arrives:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Fresh advices. Man you are in search of talked of suicide at
his club the other night. Seemed in a desperate way, and said that
if something did not soon happen he should be a lost man. Horse-flesh
and unfortunate speculations have ruined him. They say it will
take all he will ultimately receive to pay his debts.</p></div>

<p>"And below:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Suspected that he has been in your town."</p></div>

<p>A crisis was approaching round the corner. This, to
the skilled eyes of Mr. Byrd, was no longer doubtful.
Even if he had not observed the wondering glances cast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
in that direction by persons who could see the owner of
that now immovable elbow, he would have been assured
that all was not right, by the alert expression which had
now taken the place of the stolid and indifferent look
which had hitherto characterized the face of the man he
believed to be a detective.</p>

<p>A panther about to spring could not have looked more
threatening, and the wonder was, that there were no more
to observe this exciting by-play. Yet the panther did
not spring, and the inquiry went on.</p>

<p>"The witness I now propose to call," announced the
coroner, after a somewhat trying delay, "is the proprietor
of the Eastern Hotel. Ah, here he is. Mr. Symonds,
have you brought your register for the past week?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered the new-comer, with a good deal
of flurry in his manner and an embarrassed look about
him, which convinced Mr. Byrd that the words in regard
to whose origin he had been so doubtful that morning,
had been real words and no dream.</p>

<p>"Very well, then, submit it, if you please, to the jury,
and tell us in the meantime whether you have entertained
at your house this week any guest who professed to come
from Toledo?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I don't remember any such," began
the witness, in a stammering sort of way. "We have
always a great many men from the West stopping at our
house, but I don't recollect any special one who registered
himself as coming from Toledo."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>"You, however, always expect your guests to put their
names in your book?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>There was something in the troubled look of the man
which aroused the suspicion of the coroner, and he was
about to address him with another question when one of
the jury, who was looking over the register, spoke up and
asked:</p>

<p>"Who is this Clement Smith who writes himself down
here as coming from Toledo?"</p>

<p>"Smith?&mdash;Smith?" repeated Symonds, going up to
the juryman and looking over his shoulder at the book.
"Oh, yes, the gentleman who came yesterday. He&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But at this moment a slight disturbance occurring in
the other room, the witness paused and looked about him
with that same embarrassed look before noted. "He is
at the hotel now," he added, with an attempt at ease,
transparent as it was futile.</p>

<p>The disturbance to which I have alluded was of a
peculiar kind. It was occasioned by the thick-set man
making the spring which, for some minutes, he had evidently
been meditating. It was not a tragic leap, however, but
a decidedly comic one, and had for its end and aim the
recovery of a handkerchief which he had taken from his
pocket at the moment when the witness uttered the name
of Smith, and, by a useless flourish in opening it, flirted
from his hand to the floor. At least, so the amused
throng interpreted the sudden dive which he made, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the heedless haste that caused him to trip over the gentleman's
hat that stood on the floor, causing it to fall and
another handkerchief to tumble out. But Mr. Byrd, who
had a detective's insight into the whole matter, saw
something more than appeared in the profuse apologies
which the thick-set man made, and the hurried manner
in which he gathered up the handkerchiefs and stood
looking at them before returning one to his pocket and
the other to its place in the gentleman's hat. Nor was
Mr. Byrd at all astonished to observe that the stand
which his fellow-detective took, upon resettling himself,
was much nearer the unseen gentleman than before, or
that in replacing the hat, he had taken pains to put it so
far to one side that the gentleman would be obliged to
rise and come around the corner in order to obtain it.
The drift of the questions propounded to the witness at
this moment opened his eyes too clearly for him to fail
any longer to understand the situation.</p>

<p>"Now at the hotel?" the coroner was repeating.
"And came yesterday? Why, then, did you look so embarrassed
when I mentioned his name?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;well&mdash;ah," stammered the man, "because he was
there once before, though his name is not registered but
once in the book."</p>

<p>"He was? And on what day?"</p>

<p>"On Tuesday," asserted the man, with the sudden decision
of one who sees it is useless to attempt to keep
silence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"The day of the murder?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And why is his name not on the book at that time if
he came to your house and put up?"</p>

<p>"Because he did not put up; he merely called in, as it
were, and did not take a meal or hire a room."</p>

<p>"How did you know, then, that he was there? Did
you see him or talk to him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And what did you say?"</p>

<p>"He asked me for directions to a certain house, and I
gave them."</p>

<p>"Whose house?"</p>

<p>"The Widow Clemmens', sir."</p>

<p>Ah, light at last! The long-sought-for witness had
been found! Coroner and jury brightened visibly, while
the assembled crowd gave vent to a deep murmur, that
must have sounded like a knell of doom&mdash;in one pair of
ears, at least.</p>

<p>"He asked you for directions to the house of Widow
Clemmens. At what time was this?"</p>

<p>"At about half-past eleven in the morning."</p>

<p>The very hour!</p>

<p>"And did he leave then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; after taking a glass of brandy."</p>

<p>"And did you not see him again?"</p>

<p>"Not till yesterday, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah, and at what time did you see him yesterday?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>"At bedtime, sir. He came with other arrivals on the
five o'clock train; but I was away all the afternoon and
did not see him till I went into the bar-room in the
evening."</p>

<p>"Well, and what passed between you then?"</p>

<p>"Not much, sir. I asked if he was going to stay with
us, and when he said 'Yes,' I inquired if he had registered
his name. He replied 'No.' At which I pointed
to the book, and he wrote his name down and then went
up-stairs with me to his room."</p>

<p>"And is that all? Did you say nothing beyond what
you have mentioned? ask him no questions or make no
allusions to the murder?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I did make some attempt that way, for I
was curious to know what took him to the Widow Clemmens'
house, but he snubbed me so quickly, I concluded
to hold my tongue and not trouble myself any further
about the matter."</p>

<p>"And do you mean to say you haven't told any one
that an unknown man had been at your house on the
morning of the murder inquiring after the widow?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I am a poor man, and believe in keeping
out of all sort of messes. Policy demands that much of
me, gentlemen."</p>

<p>The look he received from the coroner may have convinced
him that policy can be carried too far.</p>

<p>"And now," said Dr. Tredwell, "what sort of a man is
this Clement Smith?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>"He is a gentleman, sir, and not at all the sort of person
with whom you would be likely to connect any unpleasant
suspicion."</p>

<p>The coroner surveyed the hotel-keeper somewhat
sternly.</p>

<p>"We are not talking about suspicions!" he cried;
then, in a different tone, repeated: "This gentleman, you
say, is still at your house?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, or was at breakfast-time. I have not seen
him since."</p>

<p>"We will have to call Mr. Smith as a witness," declared
the coroner, turning to the officer at his side. "Go and
see if you cannot bring him as soon as you did Mr.
Symonds."</p>

<p>But here a voice spoke up full and loud from the other
room.</p>

<p>"It is not necessary, sir. A witness you will consider
more desirable than he is in the building." And the
thick-set man showed himself for an instant to the coroner,
then walking back, deliberately laid his hand on the
elbow which for so long a time had been the centre of
Mr. Byrd's wondering conjectures.</p>

<p>In an instant the fine, gentlemanly figure of the stranger,
whom he had seen the night before in the bar-room, appeared
with a bound from beyond the jamb, and pausing
excitedly before the man, now fully discovered to all
around as a detective, asked him, in shaking tones of
suppressed terror or rage, what it was he meant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will tell you," was the ready assurance, "if you will
step out here in view of the coroner and jury."</p>

<p>With a glance that for some reason disturbed Mr. Byrd
in his newly acquired complacency, the gentleman stalked
hurriedly forward and took his stand in the door-way
leading into the room occupied by the persons mentioned.</p>

<p>"Now," he cried, "what have you to say?"</p>

<p>But the detective, who had advanced behind him, still
refrained from replying, though he gave a quick look at
the coroner, which led that functionary to glance at the
hotel-keeper and instantly ask:</p>

<p>"You know this gentleman?"</p>

<p>"It is Mr. Clement Smith."</p>

<p>A flush so violent and profuse, that even Mr. Byrd
could see it from his stand outside the window, inundated
for an instant the face and neck of the gentleman, but
was followed by no words, though the detective at his
side waited for an instant before saying:</p>

<p>"I think you are mistaken; I should call him now Mr.
Gouverneur Hildreth!"</p>

<p>With a start and a face grown as suddenly white as it
had but an instant before been red, the gentleman turned
and surveyed the detective from head to foot, saying, in
a tone of mock politeness:</p>

<p>"And why, if you please? I have never been introduced
to you that I remember."</p>

<p>"No," rejoined the detective, taking from his pocket
the handkerchief which he had previously put there, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
presenting it to the other with a bow, "but I have read
the monogram upon your handkerchief and it happens to
be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough!" interrupted the other, in a stern if not
disdainful voice. "I see I have been the victim of
espionage." And stepping into the other room, he walked
haughtily up to the coroner and exclaimed: "I am
Gouverneur Hildreth, and I come from Toledo. Now,
what is it you have to say to me?"</p>

<h3>CLOSE CALCULATIONS.</h3>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">Truth alone,</span><br />
Truth tangible and palpable; such truth<br />
As may be weighed and measured; truth deduced<br />
By logical conclusion&mdash;close, severe&mdash;<br />
From premises incontrovertible.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Moultrie.</span><br />
<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>THE excitement induced by the foregoing announcement
had, in a degree, subsided. The coroner,
who appeared to be as much startled as any one at the
result of the day's proceedings, had manifested his desire
of putting certain questions to the young man, and had
begun by such inquiries into his antecedents, and his
connection with Mrs. Clemmens, as elicited the most
complete corroboration of all Miss Firman's statements.</div>

<p>An investigation into his motives for coming East at
this time next followed, in the course of which he acknowledged
that he undertook the journey solely for the
purpose of seeing Mrs. Clemmens. And when asked
why he wished to see her at this time, admitted, with
some manifestation of shame, that he desired to see for
himself whether she was really in as strong and healthy a
condition as he had always been told; his pecuniary embarrassments
being such that he could not prevent his
mind from dwelling upon possibilities which, under any
other circumstances, he would have been ashamed to
consider.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>"And did you see Mrs. Clemmens?" the coroner inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I did."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"On Tuesday, sir; about noon."</p>

<p>The answer was given almost with bravado, and the silence
among the various auditors became intense.</p>

<p>"You admit, then, that you were in the widow's house
the morning she was murdered, and that you had an interview
with her a few minutes before the fatal blow was
struck?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>There was doggedness in the tone, and doggedness in
the look that accompanied it. The coroner moved a little
forward in his chair and uttered his next question with
deep gravity.</p>

<p>"Did you approach the widow's house by the road and
enter into it by means of the front door overlooking
the lane?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"And did you meet no one in the lane, or see no one
at the windows of any of the houses as you came by?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"How long did you stay in this house, and what was
the result of the interview which you had with Mrs. Clemmens?"</p>

<p>"I stayed, perhaps, ten minutes, and I learned nothing
from Mrs. Clemmens, save that she was well and hearty,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
and likely to live out her threescore years and ten for
all hint that her conversation or appearance gave me."</p>

<p>He spoke almost with a tone of resentment; his eyes
glowed darkly, and a thrill of horror sped through the
room as if they felt that the murderer himself stood before
them.</p>

<p>"You will tell me what was said in this interview, if
you please, and whether the widow knew who you were;
and, if so, whether any words of anger passed between
you?"</p>

<p>The face of the young man burned, and he looked at
the coroner and then at the jurymen, as if he would like
to challenge the whole crew, but the color that showed in
his face was the flush of shame, or, so thought Mr. Byrd,
and in his reply, when he gave it, there was a bitterness
of self-scorn that reminded the detective more of the mortification
of a gentleman caught in an act of meanness
than the secret alarm of a man who had been beguiled
into committing a dastardly crime.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Clemmens was evidently a woman of some
spirit," said he, forcing out his words with sullen desperation.
"She may have used sharp language; I believe
indeed she did; but she did not know who I was,
for&mdash;for I pretended to be a seller of patent medicine,
warranted to cure all ills, and she told me she had no ills,
and&mdash;and&mdash;Do you want a man to disgrace himself in
your presence?" he suddenly flashed out, cringing under
the gaze of the many curious and unsympathetic eyes
fixed upon him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>But the coroner, with a sudden assumption of severity,
pardonable, perhaps, in a man with a case of such importance
on his hands, recommended the witness to be calm
and not to allow any small feelings of personal mortification
to interfere with a testimony of so much evident
value. And without waiting for the witness to recover
himself, asked again:</p>

<p>"What did the widow say, and with what words did
you leave?"</p>

<p>"The widow said she abominated drugs, and never
took them. I replied that she made a great mistake, if
she had any ailments. Upon which she retorted that
she had no ailment, and politely showed me the door.
I do not remember that any thing else passed between
us."</p>

<p>His tone, which had been shrill and high, dropped at
the final sentence, and by the nervous workings of his
lips, Mr. Byrd perceived that he dreaded the next question.
The persons grouped around him evidently dreaded
it too.</p>

<p>But it was less searching than they expected, and
proved that the coroner preferred to approach his point
by circuitous rather than direct means.</p>

<p>"In what room was the conversation held, and by what
door did you come in and go out?"</p>

<p>"I came in by the front door, and we stood in that
room"&mdash;pointing to the sitting-room from which he had
just issued.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Stood! Did you not sit down?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Stood all the time, and in that room to which you
have just pointed?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>The coroner drew a deep breath, and looked at the
witness long and searchingly. Mr. Hildreth's way of
uttering this word had been any thing but pleasant, and
consequently any thing but satisfactory. A low murmur
began to eddy through the rooms.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, silence!" commanded the coroner, venting
in this injunction some of the uncomfortable emotion
with which he was evidently surcharged; for his next
words were spoken in a comparatively quiet voice, though
the fixed severity of his eye could have given the witness
but little encouragement.</p>

<p>"You say," he declared, "that in coming through the
lane you encountered no one. Was this equally true of
your return?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I believe so. I don't remember. I was not
looking up," was the slightly confused reply.</p>

<p>"You passed, however, through the lane, and entered
the main street by the usual path?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And where did you go then?"</p>

<p>"To the depot."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>"I wished to leave the town. I had done with it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>"And did you do so, Mr. Hildreth?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"Where did you go?"</p>

<p>"To Albany, where I had left my traps."</p>

<p>"You took the noon train, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Which leaves precisely five minutes after twelve?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so."</p>

<p>"Took it without stopping anywhere on the way?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Did you buy a ticket at the office?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I did not have time."</p>

<p>"Ah, the train was at the station, then?"</p>

<p>Mr. Hildreth did not reply; he had evidently been
driven almost to the end of his patience, or possibly of
his courage, by this quick fire of small questions.</p>

<p>The coroner saw this and pressed his advantage.</p>

<p>"Was the train at the station or not when you arrived
there, Mr. Hildreth?"</p>

<p>"I do not see why it can interest you to know," the
witness retorted, with a flash of somewhat natural anger;
"but since you insist, I will tell you that it was just going
out, and that I had to run to reach it, and only got a foothold
upon the platform of the rear car at the risk of my
life."</p>

<p>He looked as if he wished it had been at the cost of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
life, and compressed his lips and moved restlessly from
side to side as if the battery of eyes levelled upon his face
were so many points of red-hot steel burning into his
brain.</p>

<p>But the coroner, intent upon his duty, released not one
jot of the steady hold he had taken upon his victim.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hildreth," said he, "your position as the only
person who acknowledges himself to have been in this
house during the half-hour that preceded the assault,
makes every thing you can tell us in reference to your
visit of the highest importance. Was the widow alone,
do you think, or did you see any thing&mdash;pause now and
consider well&mdash;<i>any thing</i> that would lead you to suppose
there was any one beside her and yourself in the house?"</p>

<p>It was the suggestion of a just man, and Mr. Byrd
looked to see the witness grasp with all the energy of
despair at the prospect of release it held out. But Mr.
Hildreth either felt his cause beyond the reach of any
such assistance, or his understanding was so dulled by
misery he could not see the advantage of acknowledging
the presence of a third party in the cottage. Giving a
dreary shake of the head, he slowly answered:</p>

<p>"There may have been somebody else in the house, I
don't know; but if so, I didn't hear him or see him. I
thought we were alone."</p>

<p>The frankness with which he made the admission was
in his favor, but the quick and overpowering flush that
rose to his face the moment he had given utterance to it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
betrayed so unmistakable a consciousness of what the
admission implied that the effect was immediately reversed.
Seeing that he had lost rather than gained in the
opinions of the merciless inquisitors about him, he
went back to his old bravado, and haughtily lifted his
head.</p>

<p>"One question more," resumed the coroner. "You
have said that Mrs. Clemmens was a spirited woman.
Now, what made you think so? Any expression of
annoyance on her part at the interruption in her work
which your errand had caused her, or merely the expression
of her face and the general way she had of
speaking?"</p>

<p>"The latter, I think, though she did use a harsh word
or two when she showed me the door."</p>

<p>"And raised her voice?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes."</p>

<p>"Mr. Hildreth," intimated the coroner, rising, "will
you be kind enough to step with me into the adjoining
room?"</p>

<p>With a look of wonder not unmixed with alarm,
the young man prepared to comply.</p>

<p>"I should like the attention of the jury," Dr. Tredwell
signified as he passed through the door.</p>

<p>There was no need to give them this hint. Not a man
of them but was already on his feet in eager curiosity
as to what their presiding officer was about to do.</p>

<p>"I wish you to tell me now," the coroner demanded of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Mr. Hildreth, as they paused in the centre of the sitting-room,
"where it was you stood during your interview
with Mrs. Clemmens, and, if possible, take the very
position now which you held at that time."</p>

<p>"There are too many persons here," the witness
objected, visibly rebelling at a request of which he could
not guess the full significance.</p>

<p>"The people present will step back," declared the
coroner; "you will have no trouble in taking your stand
on the spot you occupied the other day."</p>

<p>"Here, then!" exclaimed the young man, taking
a position near the centre of the room.</p>

<p>"And the widow?"</p>

<p>"Stood there."</p>

<p>"Facing you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I see," intimated the coroner, pointing toward the
windows. "Her back was to the yard while you stood
with your face toward it." Then with a quick motion,
summoning the witness back into the other room, asked,
amid the breathless attention of the crowd, whom this bit
of by-play had wrought up to expectation: "Did you
observe any one go around to the back door while you
stood there, and go away again without attempting to
knock?"</p>

<p>Mr. Hildreth knitted his brow and seemed to think.</p>

<p>"Answer," persisted the coroner; "it is not a question
that requires thought."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, then, I did not," cried the witness, looking the
other directly in the eye, with the first gleam of real
manly feeling which he had yet displayed.</p>

<p>"You did not see a tramp come into the yard, walk
around to the kitchen door, wait a moment as if hesitating
whether he would rap, and then turn and come back
again without doing so?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>The coroner drew a piece of paper before him and began
figuring on it. Earnestly, almost wildly, the young
man watched him, drawing a deep breath and turning
quite pale as the other paused and looked up.</p>

<p>"Yet," affirmed the coroner, as if no delay had
occurred since he received his last answer, "such a person
did approach the house while you were in it, and if
you had stood where you say, you must have seen him."</p>

<p>It was a vital thrust, a relentless presentation of fact,
and as such shook the witness out of his lately acquired
composure. Glancing hastily about, he sought the assistance
of some one both capable and willing to advise
him in this crisis, but seeing no one, he made a vigorous
effort and called together his own faculties.</p>

<p>"Sir," he protested, a tremor of undisguised anxiety
finding way into his voice, "I do not see how you make
that all out. What proof have you that this tramp of
which you speak came to the house while I was in it?
Could he not have come before? Or, what was better,
could he not have come after?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>The ringing tone with which the last question was put
startled everybody. No such sounds had issued from his
lips before. Had he caught a glimpse of hope, or was
he driven to an extremity in his defence that forced him
to assert himself? The eyes of Miss Firman and of
a few other women began to soften, and even the face of
Mr. Byrd betrayed that a change was on the verge of taking
place in his feelings.</p>

<p>But the coroner's look and tone dashed cold water on
this young and tender growth of sympathy. Passing over
to the witness the paper on which he had been scribbling,
he explained with dry significance:</p>

<p>"It is only a matter of subtraction and addition, Mr.
Hildreth. You have said that upon quitting this house
you went directly to the depot, where you arrived barely
in time to jump on the train as it was leaving the station.
Now, to walk from this place to the depot at any pace
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'yon'">you</ins> would be likely to use, would occupy&mdash;well, let us
say seven minutes. At two minutes before twelve, then,
you were still in this house. Well!" he ejaculated, interrupting
himself as the other opened his lips, "have you
any thing to say?"</p>

<p>"No," was the dejected and hesitating reply.</p>

<p>The coroner at once resumed:</p>

<p>"But at five minutes before twelve, Mr. Hildreth, the
tramp walked into the widow's yard. Now, allowing only
two minutes for your interview with that lady, the conclusion
remains that you were in the house when he came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
up to it. Yet you declare that, although you stood in full
view of the yard, you did not see him."</p>

<p>"You figure closer than an astronomer calculating an
eclipse," burst from the young man's lips in a flash of that
resolution which had for the last few minutes animated
him. "How do you know your witnesses have been so
exact to a second when they say this and that of the goings
and comings you are pleased to put into an arithmetical
problem. A minute or two one way or the other
would make a sad discrepancy in your calculations, Mr.
Coroner."</p>

<p>"I know it," assented Dr. Tredwell, quietly ignoring
the other's heat; "but if the jury will remember, there were
four witnesses, at least, who testified to the striking of the
town clock just as the tramp finally issued from the lane,
and one witness, of well-known accuracy in matters of
detail, who declared on oath that she had just dropped
her eyes from that same clock when she observed the
tramp go into the widow's gate, and that it was five minutes
to twelve exactly. But, lest I do seem too nice
in my calculations," the coroner inexorably pursued, "I
will take the trouble of putting it another way. At what
time did you leave the hotel, Mr. Hildreth?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," was the testy response.</p>

<p>"Well, I can tell you," the coroner assured him. "It
was about twenty minutes to twelve, or possibly earlier,
but no later. My reason for saying this," he went on,
drawing once more before him the fatal sheet of paper,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
"is that Mrs. Dayton's children next door were out playing
in front of this house for some few minutes previous
to the time the tramp came into the lane. As you did
not see them you must have arrived here before they began
their game, and that, at the least calculation, would
make the time as early as a quarter to twelve."</p>

<p>"Well," the fierce looks of the other seemed to say,
"and what if it was?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Hildreth," continued the coroner, "if you were
in this house at a quarter to twelve and did not leave it
till two minutes before, and the interview was as you say
a mere interchange of a dozen words or so, that could not
possibly have occupied more than three minutes; <i>where
were you during all the rest of the time</i> that must have
elapsed after you finished your interview and the moment
you left the house?"</p>

<p>It was a knock-down question. This aristocratic-looking
young gentleman who had hitherto held himself erect before
them, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'notwithstandingt he'">notwithstanding the</ins> humiliating nature of the
inquiries which had been propounded to him, cringed
visibly and bowed his head as if a stroke of vital force
had descended upon it. Bringing his fist down on the
table near which he stood, he seemed to utter a muttered
curse, while the veins swelled on his forehead so powerfully
that more than one person present dropped their
eyes from a spectacle which bore so distinctly the stamp
of guilt.</p>

<p>"You have not answered," intimated the coroner, after
a moment of silent waiting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>"No!" was the loud reply, uttered with a force that
startled all present, and made the more timid gaze with
some apprehension at his suddenly antagonistic attitude.
"It is not pleasant for a gentleman"&mdash;he emphasized the
word bitterly&mdash;"for a <i>gentleman</i> to acknowledge himself
caught at a time like this in a decided equivocation. But
you have cornered me fairly and squarely, and I am bound
to tell the truth. Gentlemen, I did not leave the widow's
house as immediately as I said. I stayed for fully five
minutes or so alone in the small hall that leads to the
front door. In all probability I was there when the tramp
passed by on his way to the kitchen-door, and there when
he came back again." And Mr. Hildreth fixed his eyes
on the coroner as if he dared him to push him further.</p>

<p>But Dr. Tredwell had been in his present seat before.
Merely confronting the other with that cold official gaze
which seems to act like a wall of ice between a witness
and the coroner, he said the two words: "What doing?"</p>

<p>The effect was satisfactory. Paling suddenly, Mr.
Hildreth dropped his eyes and replied humbly, though
with equal laconism, "I was thinking." But scarcely had
the words left his lips, than a fresh flame of feeling started
up within him, and looking from juryman to juryman he
passionately exclaimed: "You consider that acknowledgment
suspicious. You wonder why a man should give a
few minutes to thought after the conclusion of an interview
that terminated all hope. I wonder at it now
myself. I wonder I did not go straight out of the house<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
and rush headlong into any danger that promised an
immediate extinction of my life."</p>

<p>No language could have more forcibly betrayed the
real desperation of his mind at the critical moment when
the widow's life hung in the balance. He saw this, perhaps,
when it was too late, for the sweat started on his
brow, and he drew himself up like a man nerving himself
to meet a blow he no longer hoped to avert. One
further remark, however, left his lips.</p>

<p>"Whatever I did or of whatever I was thinking, one
thing I here declare to be true, and that is, that I did not
see the widow again after she left my side and went back
to her kitchen in the rear of the house. The hand that
struck her may have been lifted while I stood in the hall,
but if so, I did not know it, nor can I tell you now who
it was that killed her."</p>

<p>It was the first attempt at direct disavowal which he
had made, and it had its effect. The coroner softened
a trifle of his austerity, and the jurymen glanced at each
other relieved. But the weight of suspicion against this
young man was too heavy, and his manner had been too
unfortunate, for this effect to last long. Gladly as many
would have been to credit this denial, if only for the name
he bore and a certain fine aspect of gentlemanhood that
surrounded him in spite of his present humiliation, it was
no longer possible to do so without question, and he
seemed to feel this and do his best to accept the situation
with patience.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>An inquiry which was put to him at this time by a
juryman showed the existent state of feeling against
him.</p>

<p>"May I ask," that individual dryly interrogated, "why
you came back to Sibley, after having left it?"</p>

<p>The response came clear and full. Evidently the
gravity of his position had at last awakened the latent
resources of Mr. Hildreth's mind.</p>

<p>"I heard of the death of this woman, and my surprise
caused me to return."</p>

<p>"How did you hear of it?"</p>

<p>"Through the newspapers."</p>

<p>"And you were surprised?"</p>

<p>"I was astounded; I felt as if I had received a blow
myself, and could not rest till I had come back where I
could learn the full particulars."</p>

<p>"So, then, it was curiosity that brought you to the
inquest to-day?"</p>

<p>"It was."</p>

<p>The juryman looked at him astonished; so did all the
rest. His manner was so changed, his answers so prompt
and ringing.</p>

<p>"And what was it," broke in the coroner, "that led you
to register yourself at the hotel under a false name?"</p>

<p>"I scarcely know," was the answer, given with less fire
and some show of embarrassment. "Perhaps I thought
that, under the circumstances, it would be better for me
not to use my own."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"In other words, you were afraid?" exclaimed the
coroner, with the full impressiveness of his somewhat
weighty voice and manner.</p>

<p>It was a word to make the weakest of men start. Mr.
Hildreth, who was conspicuous in his own neighborhood
for personal if not for moral courage, flushed till it
looked as if the veins would burst on his forehead, but
he made no other reply than a proud and angry look and
a short:</p>

<p>"I was not aware of fear; though, to be sure, I had no
premonition of the treatment I should be called upon to
suffer here to-day."</p>

<p>The flash told, the coroner sat as if doubtful, and
looked from man to man of the jury as if he would question
their feelings on this vital subject. Meantime the
full shame of his position settled heavier and heavier
upon Mr. Hildreth; his head fell slowly forward, and he
seemed to be asking himself how he was to meet the possibly
impending ignominy of a direct accusation. Suddenly
he drew himself erect, and a gleam shot from his eyes
that, for the first time, revealed him as a man of latent
pluck and courage.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he began, looking first at the coroner
and then at the jury, "you have not said you consider
me guilty of this crime, but you evidently harbor the
suspicion. I do not wonder; my own words have given
me away, and any man would find it difficult to believe
in my innocence after what has been testified to in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
this place. Do not hesitate, then. The shock of finding
myself suspected of a horrible murder is passed. I am
willing to be arrested. Indeed, after what has here taken
place, I not only am willing but even anxious. I want to
be tried, if only to prove to the world my complete and
entire innocence."</p>

<p>The effect of this speech, uttered at a moment so critical,
may be easily imagined. All the impressible people
present at once signified their belief in his honesty, and
gave him looks of sympathy, if not approval; while the
cooler and possibly the more judicious of his auditors
calmly weighed these assertions against the evidence that
had been advanced, and finding the result unsatisfactory,
shook their heads as if unconvinced, and awaited further
developments.</p>

<p>They did not come. The inquiry had reached its
climax, and little, if any thing, more was left to be said.
Mr. Hildreth was examined more fully, and some few of
the witnesses who had been heard in the early part of the
day were recalled, but no new facts came to light, and no
fresh inquiries were started.</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd, who from the attitude of the coroner could
not fail to see Mr. Hildreth was looked upon with a suspicion
that would ultimately end in arrest, decided that
his interest in the inquest was at an end, and being greatly
fatigued, gave up his position at the window and
quietly stole away.</p>

<h2>X.</h2>

<h3>THE FINAL TEST.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Men are born with two eyes, but with one tongue, in order that they
should see twice as much as they say.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Colton.</span></p><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>THE fact was, he wanted to think. Detective though
he was and accustomed to the bravado with
which every sort of criminal will turn to meet their fate
when fully driven to bay, there had been something in the
final manner of this desperate but evidently cultured
gentleman, which had impressed him against his own
will, and made him question whether the suspected man
was not rather the victim of a series of extraordinary circumstances,
than the selfish and brutal criminal which the
evidence given seemed to suggest.</div>

<p>Not that Mr. Byrd ever allowed his generous heart to
blind him to the plain language of facts. His secret and
not to be smothered doubts in another direction were
proof enough of this; and had it not been for those very
doubts, the probabilities are that he would have agreed
with the cooler-headed portion of the crowd, which listened
unmoved to that last indignant burst of desperate manhood.</p>

<p>But with those doubts still holding possession of his
mind, he could not feel so sure of Mr. Hildreth's guilt;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
and the struggle that was likely to ensue between his
personal feelings on the one side and his sense of duty on
the other did not promise to be so light as to make it
possible for him to remain within eye and earshot of an
unsympathetic crowd.</p>

<p>"If only the superintendent had not left it to my judgment
to interfere," thought he, pacing the streets with
ever-increasing uneasiness, "the responsibility would have
been shifted from my shoulders, and I would have left
the young man to his fate in peace. But now I would
be criminally at fault if I were to let him drift hopelessly
to his doom, when by a lift of my finger I might possibly
turn the attention of justice toward the real culprit."</p>

<p>Yet the making up of his mind to interfere was a torture
to Horace Byrd. If he was not conscious of any
love for Imogene Dare, he was sufficiently under the
dominion of her extraordinary fascinations to feel that
any movement on his part toward the unravelling of
the mystery that enveloped her, would be like subjecting
his own self to the rack of public inquiry and suspicion.</p>

<p>Nor, though he walked the streets for hours, each
moment growing more and more settled in his conviction
of Mr. Hildreth's innocence, could he bring himself to
the point of embracing the duty presented to him, till he
had subjected Miss Dare to a new test, and won for himself
absolute certainty as to the fact of her possessing a
clue to the crime, which had not been discovered in the
coroner's inquiry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"The possibility of innocence on her part is even
greater than on that of Mr. Hildreth," he considered,
"and nothing, not even the peril of those dearest to me,
could justify me in shifting the weight of suspicion from
a guiltless man to an equally guiltless woman."</p>

<p>It was, therefore, for the purpose of solving this doubt,
that he finally sought Mr. Ferris, and after learning that
Mr. Hildreth was under surveillance, and would in all
probability be subjected to arrest on the morrow, asked
for some errand that would take him to Mr. Orcutt's
house.</p>

<p>"I have a great admiration for that gentleman and
would like to make his acquaintance," he remarked carelessly,
hiding his true purpose under his usual nonchalant
tones. "But I do not want to seem to be pushing myself
forward; so if you could give me some papers to carry to
him, or some message requiring an introduction to his
presence, I should feel very much obliged."</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris, who had no suspicions of his own to assist
him in understanding the motives that led to this request,
easily provided the detective with the errand he sought.
Mr. Byrd at once started for the lawyer's house.</p>

<p>It was fully two miles away, but once arrived there, he
was thankful that the walk had been so long, as the
fatigue, following upon the activity of the afternoon, had
succeeded in quieting his pulses and calming down the
fierce excitement which had held him under its control
ever since he had taken the determination to satisfy his
doubts by an interview with Miss Dare.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>Ringing the bell of the rambling old mansion that
spread out its wide extensions through the vines and
bushes of an old-fashioned and most luxuriant garden, he
waited the issue with beating heart. A respectable-looking
negro servant came to the door.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Orcutt in?" he asked; "or, if not, Miss
Dare? I have a message from Mr. Ferris and would be
glad to see one of them."</p>

<p>This, in order to ascertain at a word if the lady was at
home.</p>

<p>"Miss Dare is not in," was the civil response, "and
Mr. Orcutt is very busily engaged; but if you will step
into the parlor I will tell him you are here."</p>

<p>"No," returned the disappointed detective, handing
her the note he held in his hand. "If your master is
busy I will not disturb him." And, turning away, he
went slowly down the steps.</p>

<p>"If I only knew where she was gone!" he muttered,
bitterly.</p>

<p>But he did not consider himself in a position to ask.</p>

<p>Inwardly chafing over his ill-luck, Mr. Byrd proceeded
with reluctant pace to regain the street, when, hearing the
gate suddenly click, he looked up, and saw advancing
toward him a young gentleman of a peculiarly spruce
and elegant appearance.</p>

<p>"Ha! another visitor for Miss Dare," was the detective's
natural inference. And with a sudden movement
he withdrew from the path, and paused as if to light his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
cigar in the shadow of the thick bushes that grew against
the house.</p>

<p>In an instant the young stranger was on the stoop.
Another, and he had rung the bell, which was answered
almost as soon as his hand dropped from the knob.</p>

<p>"Is Miss Dare in?" was the inquiry, uttered in loud
and cheery tones.</p>

<p>"No, sir. She is spending a few days with Miss
Tremaine," was the clear and satisfactory reply. "Shall
I tell her you have been here?"</p>

<p>"No. I will call myself at Miss Tremaine's," rejoined
the gentleman. And, with a gay swing of his cane and a
cheerful look overhead where the stars were already becoming
visible, he sauntered easily off, followed by the
envious thoughts of Mr. Byrd.</p>

<p>"Miss Tremaine," repeated the latter, musingly.
"Who knows Miss Tremaine?"</p>

<p>While he was asking himself this question, the voice of
the young man rose melodiously in a scrap of old song,
and instantly Mr. Byrd recognized in the seeming stranger
the well-known tenor singer of the church he had himself
attended the Sunday before&mdash;a gentleman, too, to whom
he had been introduced by Mr. Ferris, and with whom he
had exchanged something more than the passing civilities
of the moment.</p>

<p>To increase his pace, overtake the young man, recall
himself to his attention, and join him in his quick walk
down the street, was the work of a moment. The natural<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
sequence followed. Mr. Byrd made himself so agreeable
that by the time they arrived at Miss Tremaine's the
other felt loath to part with him, and it resulted in his being
urged to join this chance acquaintance in his call.</p>

<p>Nothing could have pleased Mr. Byrd better. So,
waiving for once his instinctive objection to any sort of
personal intrusion, he signified his acquiescence to the
proposal, and at once accompanied his new friend into the
house of the unknown Miss Tremaine. He found it
lit up as for guests. All the rooms on the ground
floor were open, and in one of them he could discern a
dashing and coquettish young miss holding court over a
cluster of eager swains.</p>

<p>"Ah, I forgot," exclaimed Mr. Byrd's companion,
whose name, by-the-way, was Duryea. "It is Miss
Tremaine's reception night. She is the daughter of one
of the professors of the High School," he went on, whispering
his somewhat late explanations into the ear of Mr.
Byrd. "Every Thursday evening she throws her house
open for callers, and the youth of the academy are only
too eager to avail themselves of the opportunity of coming
here. Well, it is all the better for us. Miss Dare
despises boys, and in all likelihood we shall have her entirely
to ourselves."</p>

<p>A quick pang contracted the breast of Mr. Byrd.
If this easy, almost rakish, fellow at his side but knew the
hideous errand which brought him to this house, what
a scene would have ensued!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>But he had no time for reflection, or even for that
irresistible shrinking from his own designs which he now
began to experience. Before he realized that he was
fully committed to this venture, he found himself in the
parlor bowing before the <i>na&iuml;ve</i> and laughing-eyed Miss
Tremaine, who rose to receive him with all the airy
graciousness of a finished coquette.</p>

<p>Miss Dare was not visible, and Mr. Byrd was just
wondering if he would be called upon to enter into a sustained
conversation with his pretty hostess, when a deep,
rich voice was heard in the adjoining room, and, looking
up, he saw the stately figure he so longed and yet dreaded
to encounter, advancing toward them through the open
door. She was very pale, and, to Mr. Byrd's eyes,
looked thoroughly worn out, if not ill. Yet, she bore
herself with a steadiness that was evidently the result of
her will; and manifested neither reluctance nor impatience
when the eager Mr. Duryea pressed forward with
his compliments, though from the fixedness of her gaze
and the immobility of her lip, Mr. Byrd too truly
discovered that her thoughts were far away from the
scene of mirth and pleasure in which she found herself.</p>

<p>"You see I have presumed to follow you, Miss Dare,"
was the greeting with which Mr. Duryea hailed her
approach. And he immediately became so engrossed
with his gallantries he forgot to introduce his companion.</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd was rather relieved at this. He was not yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
ready to submit her to the test he considered necessary
to a proper understanding of the situation; and he had
not the heart to approach her with any mere civility on
his tongue, while matters of such vital importance to her
happiness, if not to her honor, trembled in the balance.</p>

<p>He preferred to talk to Miss Tremaine, and this he continued
to do till the young fellows at his side, one by
one, edged away, leaving no one in that portion of the room
but himself and Miss Tremaine, Mr. Duryea and Miss
Dare.</p>

<p>The latter two stood together some few feet behind
him, and were discussing in a somewhat languid way, the
merits of a <i>musicale</i> which they had lately attended.
They were approaching, however, and he felt that if he
did not speak at once he might not have another opportunity
for doing so during the whole evening. Turning,
therefore, to Miss Tremaine, with more seriousness than
her gay and totally inconsequent conversation had
hitherto allowed, he asked, in what he meant to be a
simply colloquial and courteous manner, if she had heard
the news.</p>

<p>"News," she repeated, "no; is there any news?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I call it news. But, perhaps, you are not interested
in the murder that has lately taken place in this
town?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I am," she exclaimed, all eagerness at once,
while he felt rather than perceived that the couple at his
back stood suddenly still, as if his words had worked their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
spell over one heart there at least. "Papa knew Mrs.
Clemmens very well," the little lady proceeded with a
bewitchingly earnest look. "Have they found the murderer,
do you think? Any thing less than that would be
no news to me."</p>

<p>"There is every reason to suppose&mdash;&mdash;" he began, and
stopped, something in the deadly silence behind him making
it impossible for him to proceed. Happily he was not
obliged to. An interruption occurred in the shape of a
new-comer, and he was left with the fatal word on his
lips to await the approach of that severely measured step
behind him, which by this time he knew was bringing the
inscrutable Miss Dare to his side.</p>

<p>"Miss Dare, allow me to present to you Mr. Byrd. Mr.
Byrd, Miss Dare."</p>

<p>The young detective bowed. With rigid attention to
the forms of etiquette, he uttered the first few acknowledgments
necessary to the occasion, and then glanced
up.</p>

<p>She was looking him full in the face.</p>

<p>"We have met before," he was about to observe, but
not detecting the least sign of recognition in her gaze, restrained
the words and hastily dropped his eyes.</p>

<p>"Mr. Duryea informs me you are a stranger in the
town," she remarked, moving slowly to one side in a way
to rid herself of that gentleman's too immediate presence.
"Have you a liking for the place, or do you meditate any
lengthy stay?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>"No. That is," he rejoined, somewhat shaken in his
theories by the self-possession of her tone and the ease
and quietness with which she evidently prepared to enter
into a sustained conversation, "I may go away to-morrow,
and I may linger on for an indefinite length of time. It
all depends upon certain matters that will be determined for
me to-night. Sibley is a very pretty place," he observed,
startled at his own temerity in venturing the last remark.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>The word came as if forced, and she looked at Mr.
Duryea.</p>

<p>"Do you wish any thing, Miss Dare?" that gentleman
suddenly asked. "You do not look well."</p>

<p>"I am not well," she acknowledged. "No, thank you,"
she cried, as he pushed a chair toward her. "It is too
warm here. If you do not object, we will go into the
other room." And with a courteous glance that included
both gentlemen in its invitation, she led the way into the
adjoining apartment. Could it have been with the purpose
of ridding herself of the assiduities of Mr. Duryea?
The room contained half a dozen or more musical people,
and no sooner did they perceive their favorite tenor approach
than they seized upon him and, without listening
to his excuses, carried him off to the piano, leaving Miss
Dare alone with Mr. Byrd.</p>

<p>She seemed instantly to forget her indisposition. Drawing
herself up till every queenly attribute she possessed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
flashed brilliantly before his eyes, she asked, with sudden
determination, if she had been right in understanding him
to say that there was news in regard to the murder of Mrs.
Clemmens?</p>

<p>Subduing, by a strong inward effort, every token of the
emotion which her own introduction of this topic naturally
evoked, he replied in his easiest tones:</p>

<p>"Yes; there was an inquest held to-day, and the authorities
evidently think they have discovered the person
who killed her." And obliging himself to meet half-way
the fate that awaited him, he bestowed upon the lady
before him a casual glance that hid beneath its easy politeness
the greatest anxiety of his life.</p>

<p>The test worked well. From the pallor of sickness,
grief, or apprehension, her complexion whitened to the
deadlier hue of mortal terror.</p>

<p>"Impossible!" her lips seemed to breathe; and Mr.
Byrd could almost fancy he saw the hair rise on her
forehead.</p>

<p>Cursing in his heart the bitter necessity that had forced
him into this duty, he was about to address her in a way
calculated to break the spell occasioned by his last words,
when the rich and tuneful voice of the melodious
singer rose suddenly on the air, and they heard the
words:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Come rest in this bosom, my own stricken deer,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Though the herd have fled from thee, thy home is still here;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Here still is the smile that no cloud can o'ercast,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And a heart and a hand all thy own to the last."</span><br />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Instantly Mr. Byrd perceived that he should not be
obliged to speak. Though the music, or possibly the
words, struck her like a blow, it likewise served to recall
her to herself. Dropping her gaze, which had remained
fixed upon his own, she turned her face aside, saying with
forced composure:</p>

<p>"This near contact with crime is dreadful." Then
slowly, and with a quietness that showed how great
was her power of self-control when she was not under
the influence of surprise, she inquired: "And who do
they think this person is? What name do they presume
to associate with the murderer of this woman?"</p>

<p>With something of the feeling of a surgeon who nerves
himself to bury the steel in his patient's quivering flesh,
he gave his response unhesitatingly.</p>

<p>"A gentleman's, I believe. A young man connected
with her, in some strange way, by financial interests.
A Mr. Hildreth, of Toledo&mdash;Gouverneur Hildreth, I
think they call him."</p>

<p>It was not the name she expected. He saw this by
the relaxation that took place in all her features, by the
look of almost painful relief that flashed for a moment
into the eyes she turned like lightning upon him.</p>

<p>"Gouverneur Hildreth!" she repeated. And he knew
from the tone that it was not only a different name from
what she anticipated, but that it was also a strange one to
her. "I never heard of such a person," she went on
after a minute, during which the relentless mellow voice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
of the unconscious singer filled the room with the passionate
appeal:</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"Oh, what was love made for, if 't is not the same,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Through joy and through sorrow, through glory and shame!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"That is not strange," explained Mr. Byrd, drawing
nearer, as if to escape that pursuing sweetness of incongruous
song. "He is not known in this town. He only
came here the morning the unfortunate woman was murdered.
Whether he really killed her or not," he proceeded,
with forced quietness, "no one can tell, of course.
But the facts are very much against him, and the poor
fellow is under arrest."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>The word was involuntary. So was the tone of horrified
surprise in which it was uttered. But the music,
now swelling to a crescendo, drowned both word and
tone, or so she seemed to fondly imagine; for, making
another effort at self-control, she confined herself to a
quiet repetition of his words, "'Under arrest'?" and
then waited with only a suitable display of emotion for
whatever further enlightenment he chose to give her.</p>

<p>He mercifully spoke to the point.</p>

<p>"Yes, under arrest. You see he was in the house
at or near the time the deadly blow was struck. He was
in the front hall, he says, and nowhere near the woman
or her unknown assailant, but there is no evidence
against any one else, and the facts so far proved, show he
had an interest in her death, and so he has to pay the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
penalty of circumstances. And he may be guilty, who
knows," the young detective pursued, seeing she was
struck with horror and dismay, "dreadful as it is to
imagine that a gentleman of culture and breeding could
be brought to commit such a deed."</p>

<p>But she seemed to have ears for but one phrase of
all this.</p>

<p>"He was in the front hall," she repeated. "How did
he get there? What called him there?"</p>

<p>"He had been visiting the widow, and was on his way
out. He paused to collect his thoughts, he said. It
seems unaccountable, Miss Dare; but the whole thing is
strange and very mysterious."</p>

<p>She was deaf to his explanations.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose he heard the widow scream?" she
asked, tremblingly, "or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A sinking of the ringing tones whose powerful vibration
had made this conversation possible, caused her to
pause. When the notes grew loud enough again for her
to proceed, she seemed to have forgotten the question she
was about to propound, and simply inquired:</p>

<p>"Had he any thing to say about what he overheard&mdash;or
saw?"</p>

<p>"No. If he spoke the truth and stood in the hall as
he said, the sounds, if sounds there were, stopped short
of the sitting-room door, for he has nothing to say about
them."</p>

<p>A change passed over Miss Dare. She dropped her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
eyes, and an instant's pause followed this last acknowledgment.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me," she inquired, at last, speaking very
slowly, in an attempt to infuse into her voice no more
than a natural tone of interest, "how it was he came to
say he stood in that place during the assault?"</p>

<p>"He did not say he stood in that place during the
assault," was again the forced rejoinder of Mr. Byrd.
"It was by means of a nice calculation of time and events,
that it was found he must have been in the house at or
near the fatal moment."</p>

<p>Another pause; another bar of that lovely music.</p>

<p>"And he is a gentleman, you say?" was her hurried
remark at last.</p>

<p>"Yes, and a very handsome one."</p>

<p>"And they have put him in prison?"</p>

<p>"Yes, or will on the morrow."</p>

<p>She turned and leaned against a window-frame near by,
looking with eyes that saw nothing into the still vast night.</p>

<p>"I suppose he has friends," she faintly suggested.</p>

<p>"Two sisters, if no one nearer and dearer."</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Thou hast called me thy angel in moments of bliss,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And thy angel I 'll be, 'mid the horrors of this&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Through the furnace, unshrinking, thy steps to pursue,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And shield thee, and save thee&mdash;or perish there too,"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>rang the mellow song.</div>

<p>"I am not well," she suddenly cried, leaving the window
and turning quickly toward Mr. Byrd. "I am much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
obliged to you," said she, lowering her voice to a whisper,
for the last note of the song was dying away in a quivering
<i>pianissimo</i>. "I have been deeply interested in this
tragedy, and am thankful for any information in regard
to it. I must now bid you good-evening."</p>

<p>And with a stately bow into which she infused the
mingled courtesy and haughtiness of her nature, she
walked steadily away through the crowd that vainly
sought to stay her, and disappeared, almost without a
pause, behind the door that opened into the hall.</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd remained for a full half-hour after that, but
he never could tell what he did, or with whom he conversed,
or how or when he issued from the house and
made his way back to his room in the hotel. He only
knew that at midnight he was still walking the floor, and
had not yet made up his mind to take the step which his
own sense of duty now inexorably demanded.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>
<h2>XI.</h2>

<h3>DECISION.</h3>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Who dares</span><br />
To say that he alone has found the truth.<br />
<div class='sig'>
&mdash;<span class="smcap">Longfellow.</span></div><br /><br /><br />
</div>


<div class='cap'>THE next morning Mr. Ferris was startled by the
appearance in his office of Mr. Byrd, looking
wretchedly anxious and ill.</div>

<p>"I have come," said the detective, "to ask you what
you think of Mr. Hildreth's prospects. Have you made
up your mind to have him arrested for this crime?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the reply. "The evidence against him is
purely circumstantial, but it is very strong; and if no
fresh developments occur, I think there can be no doubt
about my duty. Each and every fact that comes to light
only strengthens the case against him. When he came to
be examined last night, a ring was found on his person,
which he acknowledged to having worn on the day of the
murder."</p>

<p>"He took it off during the inquest," murmured Mr.
Byrd; "I saw him."</p>

<p>"It is said by Hickory&mdash;the somewhat questionable
cognomen of your fellow-detective from New York&mdash;that
the young man manifested the most intense uneasiness
during the whole inquiry. That in fact his attention<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
was first drawn to him by the many tokens which he
gave of suppressed agitation and alarm. Indeed, Mr.
Hickory at one time thought he should be obliged to
speak to this stranger in order to prevent a scene. Once
Mr. Hildreth got up as if to go, and, indeed, if he had
been less hemmed in by the crowd, there is every reason
to believe he would have attempted an escape."</p>

<p>"Is this Hickory a man of good judgment?" inquired
Mr. Byrd, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I should say so. He seems to understand
his business. The way he procured us the testimony of
Mr. Hildreth was certainly satisfactory."</p>

<p>"I wish that, without his knowing it, I could hear him
give his opinion of this matter," intimated the other.</p>

<p>"Well, you can," rejoined Mr. Ferris, after a quick
and comprehensive survey of Mr. Byrd's countenance.
"I am expecting him here any moment, and if you see fit
to sit down behind that screen, you can, without the least
difficulty to yourself or him, hear all he has to impart."</p>

<p>"I will, then," the detective declared, a gloomy frown
suddenly corrugating his brow; and he stepped across to
the screen which had been indicated to him, and quietly
withdrew from view.</p>

<p>He had scarcely done this, when a short, quick step
was heard at the door, and a wide-awake voice called out,
cheerily:</p>

<p>"Are you alone, sir?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" ejaculated Mr. Ferris, "come in, come in. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
have been awaiting you for some minutes," he declared,
ignoring the look which the man threw hastily around the
room. "Any news this morning?"</p>

<p>"No," returned the other, in a tone of complete self-satisfaction.
"We've caged the bird and mustn't expect
much more in the way of news. I'm on my way to
Albany now, to pick up such facts about him as may be
lying around there loose, and shall be ready to start for
Toledo any day next week that you may think proper."</p>

<p>"You are, then, convinced that Mr. Hildreth is undeniably
the guilty party in this case?" exclaimed the
District Attorney, taking a whiff at his cigar.</p>

<p>"Convinced? That is a strong word, sir. A detective
is never convinced," protested the man. "He leaves
that for the judge and jury. But if you ask me if there is
any doubt about the direction in which all the circumstantial
evidence in this case points, I must retort by
asking you for a clue, or the tag-end of a clue, guiding
me elsewhere. I know," he went on, with the volubility
of a man whose work is done, and who feels he has the
right to a momentary indulgence in conversation, "that
it is not an agreeable thing to subject a gentleman like
Mr. Hildreth to the shame of a public arrest. But facts
are not partial, sir; and the gentleman has no more rights
in law than the coarsest fellow that we take up for butchering
his mother. But you know all this without my telling
you, and I only mention it to excuse any obstinacy I may
have manifested on the subject. He is mightily cut up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
about it," he again proceeded, as he found Mr. Ferris
forebore to reply. "I am told he didn't sleep a wink
all night, but spent his time alternately in pacing the floor
like a caged lion, and in a wild sort of stupor that had
something of the hint of madness in it. 'If my grandfather
had only known!' was the burden of his song;
and when any one approached him he either told them to
keep their eyes off him, or else buried his face in his
hands with an entreaty for them not to disturb the last
hours of a dying man. He evidently has no hope of
escaping the indignity of arrest, and as soon as it was
light enough for him to see, he asked for paper and pencil.
They were brought him, and a man stood over
him while he wrote. It proved to be a letter to his
sisters enjoining them to believe in his innocence, and
wound up with what was very much like an attempt at a
will. Altogether, it looks as if he meditated suicide, and
we have been careful to take from him every possible
means for his effecting his release in this way, as well as
set a strict though secret watch upon him."</p>

<p>A slight noise took place behind the screen, which at
any other time Mr. Hickory would have been the first to
notice and inquire into. As it was, it had only the effect
of unconsciously severing his train of thought and starting
him alertly to his feet.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, facing the District Attorney with
cheerful vivacity, "any orders?"</p>

<p>"No," responded Mr. Ferris. "A run down to Albany<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
seems to be the best thing for you at present. On your
return we will consult again."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir. I shall not be absent more than two
days, and, in the meantime, you will let me know if any
thing important occurs?" And, handing over his new
address, Hickory speedily took his leave.</p>

<p>"Well, Byrd, what do you think of him?"</p>

<p>For reply, Mr. Byrd stepped forth and took his stand
before the District Attorney.</p>

<p>"Has Coroner Tredwell informed you," said he, "that
the superintendent has left it to my discretion to interfere
in this matter if I thought that by so doing I could
further the ends of justice?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the language of the quick, short nod he received.</p>

<p>"Very well," continued the other, "you will pardon
me, then, if I ask you to convey to Mr. Hildreth the following
message: That if he is guiltless of this crime he
need have no fear of the results of the arrest to which he
may be subjected; that a man has interested himself in
this matter who pledges his word not to rest till he has
discovered the guilty party and freed the innocent from
suspicion."</p>

<p>"What!" cried Mr. Ferris, astonished at the severe
but determined bearing of the young man who, up to
this time, he had only seen under his lighter and more
indifferent aspect. "You don't agree with this fellow,
then, in his conclusions regarding Mr. Hildreth?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, sir. Hickory, as I judge, is an egotist. He discovered
Mr. Hildreth and brought him to the notice of
the jury, therefore Mr. Hildreth is guilty."</p>

<p>"And you?"</p>

<p>"I am open to doubt about it. Not that I would
acknowledge it to any one but you, sir."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because if I work in this case at all, or make any
efforts to follow up the clue which I believe myself to
have received, it must be done secretly, and without
raising the suspicion of any one in this town. I am not
in a position, as you know, to work openly, even if it
were advisable to do so, which it certainly is not.
What I do must be accomplished under cover, and
I ask you to help me in my self-imposed and by no
means agreeable task, by trusting me to pursue my
inquiries alone, until such time as I assure myself beyond
a doubt that my own convictions are just, and
that the man who murdered Mrs. Clemmens is some
one entirely separated from Mr. Hildreth and any
interests that he represents."</p>

<p>"You are, then, going to take up this case?"</p>

<p>The answer given was short, but it meant the deliberate
shivering of the fairest dream of love that had ever
visited Mr. Byrd's imagination.</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<h2>BOOK II.</h2>

<h2>THE WEAVING OF A WEB.</h2>




<h2>XII.</h2>

<h3>THE SPIDER.</h3>

<div class='center'>
"Thus far we run before the wind."<br /><br /><br />
</div>


<div class='cap'>IN the interview which Mr. Byrd had held with Miss
Dare he had been conscious of omitting one test
which many another man in his place would have made.
This was the utterance of the name of him whom he really
believed to be the murderer of Mrs. Clemmens. Had he
spoken this name, had he allowed himself to breathe the
words "Craik Mansell" into the ears of this agitated
woman, or even gone so far as to allude in the most careless
way to the widow's nephew, he felt sure his daring
would have been rewarded by some expression on her
part that would have given him a substantial basis for
his theories to rest upon.</div>

<p>But he had too much natural chivalry for this. His
feelings as a man got in the way of his instinct as a detective.
Nevertheless, he felt positive that his suspicions in
regard to this nephew of Mrs. Clemmens were correct,
and set about the task of fitting facts to his theory, with
all that settled and dogged determination which follows
the pursuit of a stern duty unwillingly embraced.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Two points required instant settling.</p>

<p>First, the truth or falsehood of his supposition as to
the identification of the person confronted by Miss Dare
in the Syracuse depot with the young man described by
Miss Firman as the nephew of Widow Clemmens.</p>

<p>Secondly, the existence or non-existence of proof going
to show the presence of this person at or near the house
of Mrs. Clemmens, during the time of the assault.</p>

<p>But before proceeding to satisfy himself in regard to
these essentials, he went again to the widow's house and
there spent an hour in a careful study of its inner and
outer arrangements, with a view to the formation of a
complete theory as to the manner and method of the
murder. He found that in default of believing Mr.
Hildreth the assailant, one supposition was positively
necessary, and this was that the murderer was in the
house when this gentleman came to it. A glance at the
diagram on next page will explain why.</p>

<p>The house, as you will see, has but three entrances:
the front door, at which Mr. Hildreth unconsciously
stood guard; the kitchen door, also unconsciously guarded
during the critical moment by the coming and going
of the tramp through the yard; and the dining-room
door, which, though to all appearance free from the surveillance
of any eye, was so situated in reference to the
clock at which the widow stood when attacked, that it
was manifestly impossible for any one to enter it and
cross the room to the hearth without attracting the attention
of her eye if not of her ear.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/diagram01.png" width="600" height="799" alt="Diagram" title="" />
</div>

<p>To be sure, there was the bare possibility of his having
come in by the kitchen-door, after the departure of the
tramp, but such a contingency was scarcely worth considering.
The almost certain conclusion was that he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
been in the house for some time, and was either in the
dining-room when Mrs. Clemmens returned to it from her
interview with Mr. Hildreth, or else came down to it from
the floor above by means of the staircase that so strangely
descended into that very room.</p>

<p>Another point looked equally clear. The escape of
the murderer&mdash;still in default of considering Mr. Hildreth
as such&mdash;must have been by means of one of the back
doors, and must have been in the direction of the woods.
To be sure there was a stretch of uneven and marshy
ground to be travelled over before the shelter of the trees
could be reached; but a person driven by fear could, at
a pinch, travel it in five minutes or less; and a momentary
calculation on the part of Mr. Byrd sufficed to show
him that more time than this had elapsed from the probable
instant of assault to the moment when Mr. Ferris
opened the side door and looked out upon the swamp.</p>

<p>The dearth of dwellings on the left-hand side of the
street, and, consequently, the comparative immunity
from observation which was given to that portion of the
house which over-looked the swamp, made him conclude
that this outlet from the dining-room had been the one
made use of in the murderer's flight. A glance down the
yard to the broken fence that separated the widow's land
from the boggy fields beyond, only tended to increase the
probabilities of this supposition, and, alert to gain for
himself that full knowledge of the situation necessary to
a successful conduct of this mysterious affair, he hastily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
left the house and started across the swamp, with the idea
of penetrating the woods and discovering for himself
what opportunity they afforded for concealment or
escape.</p>

<p>He had more difficulty in doing this than he expected.
The ground about the hillocks was half-sunk in water,
and the least slip to one side invariably precipitated him
among the brambles that encumbered this spot. Still, he
compassed his task in little more than five minutes,
arriving at the firm ground, and its sturdy growth of
beeches and maples, well covered with mud, but so far
thoroughly satisfied with the result of his efforts.</p>

<p>The next thing to be done was to search the woods,
not for the purpose of picking up clues&mdash;it was too late
for that&mdash;but to determine what sort of a refuge they
afforded, and whether, in the event of a man's desiring to
penetrate them quickly, many impediments would arise
in the shape of tangled underground or loose-lying
stones.</p>

<p>He found them remarkably clear; so much so, indeed,
that he travelled for some distance into their midst before
he realized that he had passed beyond their borders.
More than this, he came ere long upon something like a
path, and, following it, emerged into a sort of glade,
where, backed up against a high rock, stood a small and
seemingly deserted hut. It was the first object he had
met with that in any way suggested the possible presence
of man, and advancing to it with cautious steps, he looked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
into its open door-way. Nothing met his eyes but an
empty interior, and without pausing to bestow upon the
building a further thought, he hurried on through a path
he saw opening beyond it, till he came to the end of the
wood.</p>

<p>Stepping forth, he paused in astonishment. Instead
of having penetrated the woods in a direct line, he found
that he had merely described a half circle through them,
and now stood on a highway leading directly back into
the town.</p>

<p>Likewise, he was in full sight of the terminus of a line
of horse-cars that connected this remote region of Sibley
with its business portion, and though distant a good mile
from the railway depot, was, to all intents and purposes,
as near that means of escape as he would have been in
the street in front of Widow Clemmens' house.</p>

<p>Full of thoughts and inly wondering over the fatality
that had confined the attention of the authorities to the
approaches afforded by the lane, to the utter exclusion of
this more circuitous, but certainly more elusive, road of
escape, he entered upon the highway, and proceeded to
gain the horse-car he saw standing at the head of the road,
a few rods away. As he did so, he for the first time realized
just where he was. The elegant villa of Professor
Darling rising before him on the ridge that ran along on
the right-hand side of the road, made it at once evident
that he was on the borders of that choice and aristocratic
quarter known as the West Side. It was a new region to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
him, and, pausing for a moment, he cast his eyes over the
scene which lay stretched out before him. He had frequently
heard it said that the view commanded by the
houses on the ridge was the finest in the town, and he was
not disappointed in it. As he looked across the verdant
basin of marshy ground around which the road curved
like a horseshoe, he could see the city spread out like a
map before him. So unobstructed, indeed, was the view
he had of its various streets and buildings, that he thought
he could even detect, amid the taller and more conspicuous
dwellings, the humble walls and newly-shingled roof
of the widow's cottage.</p>

<p>But he could not be sure of this; his eyesight was any
thing but trustworthy for long distances, and hurrying
forward to the car, he took his seat just as it was about
to start.</p>

<p>It carried him straight into town, and came to a standstill
not ten feet from the railroad depot. As he left it
and betook himself back to his hotel, he gave to his
thoughts a distinct though inward expression.</p>

<p>"If," he mused, "my suppositions in regard to this
matter are true, and another man than Mr. Hildreth
struck the fatal blow, then I have just travelled over the
self-same route he took in his flight."</p>

<p>But were his suppositions true? It remained for him to
determine.</p>

<h2>XIII.</h2>

<h3>THE FLY.</h3>

<div class='center'>
Like&mdash;but oh! how different.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wordsworth.</span><br />
<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>THE paper mill of Harrison, Goodman &amp; Chamberlain
was situated in one of the main thoroughfares
of Buffalo. It was a large but otherwise unpretentious
building, and gave employment to a vast number of
operatives, mostly female.</div>

<p>Some of these latter might have been surprised, and
possibly a little fluttered, one evening, at seeing a well-dressed
young gentleman standing at the gate as they
came forth, gazing with languid interest from one face to
another, as if he were on the look-out for some one of
their number.</p>

<p>But they would have been yet more astonished could
they have seen him still lingering after the last one had
passed, watching with unabated patience the opening and
shutting of the small side door devoted to the use of the
firm, and such employ&eacute;s as had seats in the office. It
was Mr. Byrd, and his purpose there at this time of day
was to see and review the whole rank and file of the
young men employed in the place, in the hope of being
able to identify the nephew of Mrs. Clemmens by his supposed
resemblance to the person whose character of face
and form had been so minutely described to him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>For Mr. Byrd was a just man and a thoughtful one, and
knowing this identification to be the key-stone of his
lately formed theory, desired it to be complete and of no
doubtful character. He accordingly held fast to his
position, watching and waiting, seemingly in vain, for the
dark, powerful face and the sturdily-built frame of the
gentleman whose likeness he had attempted to draw in
conjunction with that of Miss Dare. But, though he saw
many men of all sorts and kinds issue from one door or
another of this vast building, not one of them struck him
with that sudden and unmistakable sense of familiarity
which he had a right to expect, and he was just beginning
to doubt if the whole framework of his elaborately-formed
theory was not destined to fall into ruins, when the small
door, already alluded to, opened once more, and a couple
of gentlemen came out.</p>

<p>The appearance of one of them gave Mr. Byrd a start.
He was young, powerfully built, wore a large mustache,
and had a complexion of unusual swarthiness. There
was character, too, in his face, though not so much as Mr.
Byrd had expected to see in the nephew of Mrs. Clemmens.
Still, people differ about degrees of expression,
and to his informant this face might have appeared strong.
He was dressed in a business suit, and was without an
overcoat&mdash;two facts that made it difficult for Mr. Byrd
to get any assistance from the cut and color of his
clothes.</p>

<p>But there was enough in the general style and bearing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
of this person to make Mr. Byrd anxious to know his
name. He, therefore, took it upon himself to follow
him&mdash;a proceeding which brought him to the corner just
in time to see the two gentlemen separate, and the especial
one in whom he was interested, step into a car.</p>

<p>He succeeded in getting a seat in the same car, and for
some blocks had the pleasure of watching the back of the
supposed Mansell, as he stood on the front platform with
the driver. Then others got in, and the detective's view
was obstructed, and presently&mdash;he never could tell how
it was&mdash;he lost track of the person he was shadowing,
and when the chance came for another sight of the driver
and platform, the young man was gone.</p>

<p>Annoyed beyond expression, Mr. Byrd went to a hotel,
and next day sent to the mill and procured the address
of Mr. Mansell. Going to the place named, he found it
to be a very respectable boarding-house, and, chancing
upon a time when more or less of the rooms were empty,
succeeded in procuring for himself an apartment there.</p>

<p>So here he was a fixture in the house supposed by him
to hold the murderer of Mrs. Clemmens. When the
time for dinner came, and with it an opportunity for settling
the vexed question of Mr. Mansell's identity not
only with the man in the Syracuse depot, but with the
person who had eluded his pursuit the day before, something
of the excitement of the hunter in view of his game
seized upon this hitherto imperturbable detective, and it
was with difficulty he could sustain his usual <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of fashionable
indifference.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>He arrived at the table before any of the other boarders,
and presently a goodly array of amiable matrons, old
and young gentlemen, and pretty girls came filing into the
room, and finally&mdash;yes, finally&mdash;the gentleman whom he
had followed from the mill the day before, and whom he
now had no hesitation in fixing upon as Mr. Mansell.</p>

<p>But the satisfaction occasioned by the settlement of
this perplexing question was dampened somewhat by a
sudden and uneasy sense of being himself at a disadvantage.
Why he should feel thus he did not know. Perhaps
the almost imperceptible change which took place
in that gentleman's face as their eyes first met, may have
caused the unlooked-for sensation; though why Mr.
Mansell should change at the sight of one who must have
been a perfect stranger to him, was more than Mr. Byrd
could understand. It was enough that the latter felt he
had made a mistake in not having donned a disguise
before entering this house, and that, oppressed by the
idea, he withdrew his attention from the man he had
come to watch, and fixed it upon more immediate and
personal matters.</p>

<p>The meal was half over. Mr. Byrd who, as a stranger
of more than ordinary good looks and prepossessing manners,
had been placed by the obliging landlady between
her own daughter and a lady of doubtful attractions, was
endeavoring to improve his advantages and make himself
as agreeable as possible to both of his neighbors,
when he heard a lady near him say aloud, "You are late,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Mr. Mansell," and, looking up in his amazement, saw
entering the door&mdash;&mdash; Well, in the presence of the real
owner of this name, he wondered he ever could have
fixed upon the other man as the original of the person
that had been described to him. The strong face, the
sombre expression, the herculean frame, were unique,
and in the comparison which they inevitably called forth,
made all other men in the room look dwarfed if not
actually commonplace.</p>

<p>Greatly surprised at this new turn of affairs, and satisfied
that he at last had before him the man who had confronted
Miss Dare in the Syracuse depot, he turned his
attention back to the ladies. He, however, took care to
keep one ear open on the side of the new-comer, in the
hope of gleaning from his style and manner of conversation
some notion of his disposition and nature.</p>

<p>But Craik Mansell was at no time a talkative man, and
at this especial period of his career was less inclined than
ever to enter into the trivial debates or good-natured
repartee that was the staple of conversation at Mrs.
Hart's table.</p>

<p>So Mr. Byrd's wishes in this regard were foiled. He
succeeded, however, in assuring himself by a square look,
into the other's face, that to whatever temptation this man
may have succumbed, or of whatever crime he may have
been guilty, he was by nature neither cold, cruel, nor
treacherous, and that the deadly blow, if dealt by him,
was the offspring of some sudden impulse or violent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
ebullition of temper, and was being repented of with
every breath he drew.</p>

<p>But this discovery, though it modified Mr. Byrd's own
sense of personal revolt against the man, could not influence
him in the discharge of his duty, which was to save
another of less interesting and perhaps less valuable traits
of character from the consequences of a crime he had
never committed. It was, therefore, no more than just,
that, upon withdrawing from the table, he should endeavor
to put himself in the way of settling that second question,
upon whose answer in the affirmative depended the rightful
establishment of his secret suspicions.</p>

<p>That was, whether this young man was at or near the
house of his aunt at the time when she was assaulted.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hart's parlors were always thrown open to her
boarders in the evening.</p>

<p>There, at any time from seven to ten, you might meet
a merry crowd of young people intent upon enjoying
themselves, and usually highly successful in their endeavors
to do so. Into this throng Mr. Byrd accordingly
insinuated himself, and being of the sort to win instant
social recognition, soon found he had but to make his
choice in order to win for himself that <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> conversation
from which he hoped so much. He consequently
surveyed the company with a critical eye, and soon made
up his mind as to which lady was the most affable in her
manners and the least likely to meet his advances with
haughty reserve, and having won an introduction to her,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
sat down at her side with the stern determination of
making her talk about Mr. Mansell.</p>

<p>"You have a very charming company here," he remarked;
"the house seems to be filled with a most
cheerful class of people."</p>

<p>"Yes," was the not-unlooked-for reply. "We are all
merry enough if we except Mr. Mansell. But, of course,
there is excuse for him. No one expects him to join in
our sports."</p>

<p>"Mr. Mansell? the gentleman who came in late to
supper?" repeated Mr. Byrd, with no suggestion of the
secret satisfaction he felt at the immediate success of his
scheme.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is in great trouble, you know; is the nephew
of the woman who was killed a few days ago at Sibley,
don't you remember? The widow lady who was struck
on the head by a man of the name of Hildreth, and who
died after uttering something about a ring, supposed by
many to be an attempt on her part to describe the murderer?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the slow, almost languid, response; "and
a dreadful thing, too; quite horrifying in its nature. And
so this Mr. Mansell is her nephew?" he suggestively repeated.
"Odd! I suppose he has told you all about the
affair?"</p>

<p>"He? Mercy! I don't suppose you could get him to
say anything about it to save your life. He isn't of the
talking sort. Besides, I don't believe he knows any more
about it than you or I. He hasn't been to Sibley."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>"Didn't he go to the funeral?"</p>

<p>"No; he said he was too ill; and indeed he was shut
up one whole day with a terrible sore throat. He is the
heir, too, of all her savings, they say; but he won't go
to Sibley. Some folks think it is queer, but I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here her eyes wandered and her almost serious look
vanished in a somewhat coquettish smile. Following her
gaze with his own, Mr. Byrd perceived a gentleman approaching.
It was the one he had first taken for Mr.
Mansell.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon," was the somewhat abrupt salutation
with which this person advanced. "But they are proposing
a game in the next room, and Miss Clayton's assistance
is considered absolutely indispensable."</p>

<p>"Mr. Brown, first allow me to make you acquainted
with Mr. Byrd," said the light-hearted damsel, with a
gracious inclination. "As you are both strangers, it is
well for you to know each other, especially as I expect
you to join in our games."</p>

<p>"Thank you," protested Mr. Brown, "but I don't
play games." Then seeing the deep bow of acquiescence
which Mr. Byrd was making, added, with what appeared
to be a touch of jealousy, "Except under strong provocation,"
and holding out his arm, offered to escort the
young lady into the next room.</p>

<p>With an apologetic glance at Mr. Byrd, she accepted
the attention proffered her, and speedily vanished into
the midst of the laughing group that awaited her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Byrd found himself alone.</p>

<p>"Check number one," thought he; and he bestowed
any thing but an amiable benediction upon the man who
had interrupted him in the midst of so promising a conversation.</p>

<p>His next move was in the direction of the landlady's
daughter, who, being somewhat shy, favored a retired
nook behind the piano. They had been neighbors at
table, and he could at once address her without fear of
seeming obtrusive.</p>

<p>"I do not see here the dark young gentleman whom
you call Mr. Mansell?" he remarked, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; he is in trouble. A near relative of his was
murdered in cold blood the other day, and under the
most aggravating circumstances. Haven't you heard
about it? She was a Mrs. Clemmens, and lived in Sibley.
It was in all the papers."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes; I remember about it very well. And so he
is her nephew," he went on, recklessly repeating himself
in his determination to elicit all he could from these
young and thoughtless misses. "A peculiar-looking
young man; has the air of thoroughly understanding
himself."</p>

<p>"Yes, he is very smart, they say."</p>

<p>"Does he never talk?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; that is, he used to; but, since his aunt's
death, we don't expect it. He is very much interested in
machinery, and has invented something&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Clara, you are not going to sit here," interposed
the reproachful voice of a saucy-eyed maiden, who at this
moment peeped around the corner of the piano. "We
want all the recruits we can get," she cried, with a sudden
blush, as she encountered the glance of Mr. Byrd.
"Do come, and bring the gentleman too." And she
slipped away to join that very Mr. Brown who, by his importunities,
had been the occasion of the former interruption
from which Mr. Byrd had suffered.</p>

<p>"That man and I will quarrel yet," was the mental
exclamation with which the detective rose. "Shall we
join your friends?" asked he, assuming an unconcern he
was far from feeling.</p>

<p>"Yes, if you please," was the somewhat timid, though
evidently pleased, reply.</p>

<p>And Mr. Byrd noted down in his own mind check
number two.</p>

<p>The game was a protracted one. Twice did he think
to escape from the merry crowd he had entered, and
twice did he fail to do so. The indefatigable Brown
would not let him slip, and it was only by a positive
exertion of his will that he finally succeeded in withdrawing
himself.</p>

<p>"I wish to have a word with your mother," he explained,
in reply to the look of protest with which Miss
Hart honored his departure. "I hear she retires early;
so you will excuse me if I leave somewhat abruptly."</p>

<p>And to Mrs. Hart's apartment he at once proceeded,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
and, by dint of his easy assurance, soon succeeded in
leading her, as he had already done the rest, into a discussion
of the one topic for which he had an interest.
He had not time, however, to glean much from her, for,
just as she was making the admission that Mr. Mansell
had not been home at the time of the murder, a knock
was heard at the door, and, with an affable bow and a
short, quick stare of surprise at Mr. Byrd, the ubiquitous
Mr. Brown stepped in and took a seat on the sofa, with
every appearance of intending to make a call.</p>

<p>At this third check, Mr. Byrd was more than annoyed.
Rising, however, with the most amiable courtesy, he
bowed his acknowledgments to the landlady, and, without
heeding her pressing invitation to remain and make the
acquaintance of Mr. Brown, left the room and betook
himself back to the parlors.</p>

<p>He was just one minute too late. The last of the
boarders had gone up-stairs, and only an empty room met
his eyes.</p>

<p>He at once ascended to his own apartment. It was on
the fourth floor. There were many other rooms on this
floor, and for a moment he could not remember which
was his own door. At last, however, he felt sure it was
the third one from the stairs, and, going to it, gave a
short knock in case of mistake, and, hearing no reply,
opened it and went in.</p>

<p>The first glance assured him that his recollection had
played him false, and that he was in the wrong room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
The second, that he was in that of Mr. Mansell. The
sight of the small model of a delicate and intricate
machine that stood in full view on a table before him
would have been sufficient assurance of this fact, even if
the inventor himself had been absent. But he was there.
Seated at a table, with his back to the door, and his head
bowed forward on his arms, he presented such a picture
of misery or despair, that Mr. Byrd felt his sympathies
touched in spite of himself, and hastily stumbling backward,
was about to confusedly withdraw, when a doubt
struck him as to the condition of the deathly, still, and
somewhat pallid figure before him, and, stepping hurriedly
forward, he spoke the young man's name, and, failing to
elicit a response, laid his hand on his shoulder, with an
apology for disturbing him, and an inquiry as to how he
felt.</p>

<p>The touch acted where the voice had failed. Leaping
from his partly recumbent position, Craik Mansell faced
the intruder with indignant inquiry written in every line
of his white and determined face.</p>

<p>"To what do I owe this intrusion?" he cried, his
nostrils expanding and contracting with an anger that
proved the violence of his nature when aroused.</p>

<p>"First, to my carelessness," responded Mr. Byrd;
"and, secondly&mdash;&mdash;" But there he paused, for the first
time in his life, perhaps, absolutely robbed of speech.
His eye had fallen upon a picture that the other held
clutched in his vigorous right hand. It was a photograph<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
of Imogene Dare, and it was made conspicuous by
two heavy black lines which had been relentlessy drawn
across the face in the form of a cross. "Secondly," he
went on, after a moment, resolutely tearing his gaze away
from this startling and suggestive object, "to my fears.
I thought you looked ill, and could not forbear making
an effort to reassure myself that all was right."</p>

<p>"Thank you," ejaculated the other, in a heavy weariful
tone. "I am perfectly well." And with a short bow
he partially turned his back, with a distinct intimation
that he desired to be left alone.</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd could not resist this appeal. Glad as he
would have been for even a moment's conversation with
this man, he was, perhaps unfortunately, too much of a
gentleman to press himself forward against the expressed
wishes even of a suspected criminal. He accordingly
withdrew to the door, and was about to open it and go
out, when it was flung violently forward, and the ever-obtrusive
Brown stepped in.</p>

<p>This second intrusion was more than unhappy Mr.
Mansell could stand. Striding passionately forward, he
met the unblushing Brown at full tilt, and angrily pointing
to the door, asked if it was not the custom of gentlemen
to knock before entering the room of strangers.</p>

<p>"I beg pardon," said the other, backing across the
threshold, with a profuse display of confusion. "I had
no idea of its being a stranger's room. I thought it was
my own. I&mdash;I was sure that my door was the third from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
the stairs. Excuse me, excuse me." And he bustled
noisily out.</p>

<p>This precise reproduction of his own train of thought
and action confounded Mr. Byrd.</p>

<p>Turning with a deprecatory glance to the perplexed
and angry occupant of the room, he said something
about not knowing the person who had just left them;
and then, conscious that a further contemplation of the
stern and suffering countenance before him would unnerve
him for the duty he had to perform, hurriedly
withdrew.</p>

<h3>A LAST ATTEMPT.</h3>

<div class='poem'>
When Fortune means to men most good,<br />
She looks upon them with a threatening eye.&mdash;<span class="smcap">King John.</span><br />
<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>THE sleep of Horace Byrd that night was any thing
but refreshing. In the first place, he was
troubled about this fellow Brown, whose last impertinence
showed he was a man to be watched, and, if
possible, understood. Secondly, he was haunted by a
vision of the unhappy youth he had just left; seeing,
again and again, both in his dreams and in the rush of
heated fancies which followed his awaking, that picture
of utter despair which the opening of his neighbor's door
had revealed. He could not think of that poor mortal
as sleeping. Whether it was the result of his own sympathetic
admiration for Miss Dare, or of some subtle clairvoyance
bestowed upon him by the darkness and stillness
of the hour, he felt assured that the quiet watch he
had interrupted by his careless importunity, had been
again established, and that if he could tear down the
partition separating their two rooms, he should see that
bowed form and buried face crouched despairingly above
the disfigured picture. The depths of human misery and
the maddening passions that underlie all crime had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
revealed to him for the first time, perhaps, in all their
terrible suggestiveness, and he asked himself over and
over as he tossed on his uneasy pillow, if he possessed
the needful determination to carry on the scheme he had
undertaken, in face of the unreasoning sympathies which
the fathomless misery of this young man had aroused.
Under the softening influences of the night, he answered,
No; but when the sunlight came and the full flush of
life with its restless duties and common necessities awoke
within him, he decided, Yes.</div>

<p>Mr. Mansell was not at the breakfast-table when Mr.
Byrd came down. His duties at the mill were peremptory,
and he had already taken his coffee and gone. But
Mr. Brown was there, and at sight of him Mr. Byrd's
caution took alarm, and he bestowed upon this intrusive
busybody a close and searching scrutiny. It, however,
elicited nothing in the way of his own enlightenment beyond
the fact that this fellow, total stranger though he
seemed, was for some inexplicable reason an enemy to
himself or his plans.</p>

<p>Not that Mr. Brown manifested this by any offensive
token of dislike or even of mistrust. On the contrary,
he was excessively polite, and let slip no opportunity of
dragging Mr. Byrd into the conversation. Yet, for all
that, a secret influence was already at work against the
detective, and he could not attribute it to any other
source than the jealous efforts of this man. Miss Hart
was actually curt to him, and in the attitude of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
various persons about the board he detected a certain reserve
which had been entirely absent from their manner
the evening before.</p>

<p>But while placing, as he thought, due weight upon this
fellow's animosity, he had no idea to what it would lead,
till he went up-stairs. Mrs. Hart, who had hitherto
treated him with the utmost cordiality, now called him
into the parlor, and told him frankly that she would be
obliged to him if he would let her have his room. To be
sure, she qualified the seeming harshness of her request
by an intimation that a permanent occupant had applied
for it, and offered to pay his board at the hotel till
he could find a room to suit him in another house; but
the fact remained that she was really in a flutter to rid
herself of him, and no subterfuge could hide it, and Mr.
Byrd, to whose plans the full confidence of those around
him was essential, found himself obliged to acquiesce in
her desires, and announce at once his willingness to depart.</p>

<p>Instantly she was all smiles, and overwhelmed him with
overtures of assistance; but he courteously declined her
help, and, flying from her apologies with what speed he
could, went immediately to his room. Here he sat down
to deliberate.</p>

<p>The facts he had gleaned, despite the interference of
his unknown enemy, were three:</p>

<p>First, that Craik Mansell had found excuses for not attending
the inquest, or even the funeral, of his murdered
aunt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>Secondly, that he had a strong passion for invention,
and had even now the model of a machine on hand.</p>

<p>And third, that he was not at home, wherever else
he may have been, on the morning of the murder in
Sibley.</p>

<p>"A poor and meagre collection of insignificant facts,"
thought Mr. Byrd. "Too poor and meagre to avail
much in stemming the tide threatening to overwhelm
Gouverneur Hildreth."</p>

<p>But what opportunity remained for making them
weightier? He was turned from the house that held the
few persons from whom he could hope to glean more
complete and satisfactory information, and he did
not know where else to seek it unless he went to the
mill. And this was an alternative from which he shrank,
as it would, in the first place, necessitate a revelation of his
real character; and, secondly, make known the fact that
Mr. Mansell was under the surveillance of the police, if
not in the actual attitude of a suspected man.</p>

<p>A quick and hearty, "Shure, you are very good,
sir!" uttered in the hall without roused him from his
meditations and turned his thoughts in a new direction.
What if he could learn something from the servants? He
had not thought of them. This girl, now, whose work
constantly carried her into the various rooms on this
floor, would, of course, know whether Mr. Mansell had
been away on the day of the murder, even if she
could not tell the precise time of his return. At all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
events, it was worth while to test her with a question
or two before he left, even if he had to resort to the
means of spurring her memory with money. His failure
in other directions did not necessitate a failure here.</p>

<p>He accordingly called her in, and showing her a
bright silver dollar, asked her if she thought it good
enough pay for a short answer to a simple question.</p>

<p>To his great surprise she blushed and drew back, shaking
her head and muttering that her mistress didn't like
to have the girls talk to the young men about the house,
and finally going off with a determined toss of her frowsy
head, that struck Mr. Byrd aghast, and made him believe
more than ever that his evil star hung in the ascendant,
and that the sooner he quit the house the better.</p>

<p>In ten minutes he was in the street.</p>

<p>But one thing now remained for him to do. He must
make the acquaintance of one of the mill-owners, or
possibly of an overseer or accountant, and from him learn
where Mr. Mansell had been at the time of his aunt's
murder. To this duty he devoted the day; but here
also he was met by unexpected difficulties. Though he
took pains to disguise himself before proceeding to the
mill, all the endeavors which he made to obtain an interview
there with any responsible person were utterly fruitless.
Whether his ill-luck at the house had followed him
to this place he could not tell, but, for some reason or
other, there was not one of the gentlemen for whom he
inquired but had some excuse for not seeing him; and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
worn out at last with repeated disappointments, if not
oppressed by the doubtful looks he received from the
various subordinates who carried his messages, he left the
building, and proceeded to make use of the only means
now left him of compassing his end.</p>

<p>This was to visit Mr. Goodman, the one member of the
firm who was not at his post that day, and see if from
him he could gather the single fact he was in search of.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the atmosphere of distrust with which I am
surrounded in this quarter has not reached this gentleman's
house," thought he. And having learned from the
directory where that house was, he proceeded immediately
to it.</p>

<p>His reception was by no means cordial. Mr. Goodman
had been ill the night before, and was in no mood
to see strangers.</p>

<p>"Mansell?" he coolly repeated, in acknowledgment
of the other's inquiry as to whether he had a person of
that name in his employ. "Yes, our book-keeper's
name is Mansell. May I ask"&mdash;and here Mr. Byrd felt
himself subjected to a thorough, if not severe, scrutiny&mdash;"why
you come to me with inquiries concerning him?"</p>

<p>"Because," the determined detective responded, adopting
at once the bold course, "you can put me in possession
of a fact which it eminently befits the cause of
justice to know. I am an emissary, sir, from the District
Attorney at Sibley, and the point I want settled is,
where Mr. Mansell was on the morning of the twenty-sixth
of September?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>This was business, and the look that involuntarily
leaped into Mr. Goodman's eye proved that he considered
it so. He did not otherwise betray this feeling, however,
but turned quite calmly toward a chair, into which he
slowly settled himself before replying:</p>

<p>"And why do you not ask the gentleman himself where
he was? He probably would be quite ready to tell you."</p>

<p>The inflection he gave to these words warned Mr.
Byrd to be careful. The truth was, Mr. Goodman was
Mr. Mansell's best friend, and as such had his own
reasons for not being especially communicative in his
regard, to this stranger. The detective vaguely felt this,
and immediately changed his manner.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt of that, sir," he ingenuously answered.
"But Mr. Mansell has had so much to distress him lately,
that I was desirous of saving him from the unpleasantness
which such a question would necessarily cause. It
is only a small matter, sir. A person&mdash;it is not essential
to state whom&mdash;has presumed to raise the question
among the authorities in Sibley as to whether Mr. Mansell,
as heir of poor Mrs. Clemmens' small property,
might not have had some hand in her dreadful death.
There was no proof to sustain the assumption, and Mr.
Mansell was not even known to have been in the town on
or after the day of her murder; but justice, having
listened to the aspersion, felt bound to satisfy itself of its
falsity; and I was sent here to learn where Mr. Mansell
was upon that fatal day. I find he was not in Buffalo.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
But this does not mean he was in Sibley, and I am sure
that, if you will, you can supply me with facts that will
lead to a complete and satisfactory <i>alibi</i> for him."</p>

<p>But the hard caution of the other was not to be moved.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," said he, "but I can give you no information
in regard to Mr. Mansell's travels. You will have
to ask the gentleman himself."</p>

<p>"You did not send him out on business of your own,
then?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"But you knew he was going?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And can tell when he came back?"</p>

<p>"He was in his place on Wednesday."</p>

<p>The cold, dry nature of these replies convinced Mr.
Byrd that something more than the sullen obstinacy of
an uncommunicative man lay behind this determined
reticence. Looking at Mr. Goodman inquiringly, he
calmly remarked:</p>

<p>"You are a friend of Mr. Mansell?"</p>

<p>The answer came quick and coldly:</p>

<p>"He is a constant visitor at my house."</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd made a respectful bow.</p>

<p>"You can, then, have no doubts of his ability to prove
an <i>alibi?</i>"</p>

<p>"I have no doubts concerning Mr. Mansell," was the
stern and uncompromising reply.</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd at once felt he had received his dismissal.
But before making up his mind to go, he resolved upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
one further effort. Calling to his aid his full power of
acting, he slowly shook his head with a thoughtful air,
and presently murmured half aloud and half, as it were,
to himself:</p>

<p>"I thought, possibly, he might have gone to Washington."
Then, with a casual glance at Mr. Goodman,
added: "He is an inventor, I believe?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was again the laconic response.</p>

<p>"Has he not a machine at present which he desires to
bring to the notice of some capitalist?"</p>

<p>"I believe he has," was the forced and none too amiable
answer.</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd at once leaned confidingly forward.</p>

<p>"Don't you think," he asked, "that he may have gone
to New York to consult with some one about this pet
hobby of his? It would certainly be a natural thing for
him to do, and if I only knew it was so, I could go back
to Sibley with an easy conscience."</p>

<p>His disinterested air, and the tone of kindly concern
which he had adopted, seemed at last to produce its effect
on his companion. Relaxing a trifle of his austerity, Mr.
Goodman went so far as to admit that Mr. Mansell had
told him that business connected with his patent had
called him out of town; but beyond this he would allow
nothing; and Mr. Byrd, baffled in his attempts to elicit
from this man any distinct acknowledgment of Mr. Mansell's
whereabouts at the critical time of Mrs. Clemmens'
death, made a final bow and turned toward the door.</p>

<p>It was only at this moment he discovered that Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Goodman and himself had not been alone in the room;
that curled up in one of the window-seats was a little girl
of some ten or twelve years of age, who at the first tokens
of his taking his departure slipped shyly down to the
floor and ran before him out into the hall. He found
her by the front door when he arrived there. She was
standing with her hand on the knob, and presented such
a picture of childish eagerness, tempered by childish timidity,
that he involuntarily paused before her with a
smile. She needed no further encouragement.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, I know about Mr. Mansell!" she cried. "He
wasn't in that place you talk about, for he wrote a letter
to papa just the day before he came back, and the postmark
on the envelope was Monteith. I remember, because
it was the name of the man who made our big
map." And, looking up with that eager zeal which marks
the liking of very little folks for some one favorite person
among their grown acquaintances, she added, earnestly:
"I do hope you won't let them say any thing bad about
Mr. Mansell, he is so good."</p>

<p>And without waiting for a reply, she ran off, her curls
dancing, her eyes sparkling, all her little innocent form
alive with the joy of having done a kindness, as she
thought, for her favorite, Mr. Mansell.</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd, on the contrary, felt a strange pang that the
information he had sought for so long and vainly should
come at last from the lips of an innocent child.</p>

<p>Monteith, as you remember, was the next station to
Sibley.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>
<h2>XV.</h2>

<h3>THE END OF A TORTUOUS PATH.</h3>

<div class='center'>
Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hamlet.</span><br />
<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>THE arrest of Mr. Hildreth had naturally quieted
public suspicion by fixing attention upon a definite
point, so that when Mr. Byrd returned to Sibley he
found that he could pursue whatever inquiries he chose
without awakening the least mistrust that he was on the
look-out for the murderer of Mrs. Clemmens.</div>

<p>The first use he made of his time was to find out if Mr.
Mansell, or any man answering to his description, had
been seen to take the train from the Sibley station on the
afternoon or evening of the fatal Tuesday. The result
was unequivocal. No such person had been seen there,
and no such person was believed to have been at the
station at any time during that day. This was his first
disappointment.</p>

<p>He next made the acquaintance of the conductors on
that line of street-cars by means of which he believed
Mr. Mansell to have made his escape. But with no better
result. Not one of them remembered having taken
up, of late, any passenger from the terminus, of the appearance
described by Mr. Byrd.</p>

<p>And this was his second disappointment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>His next duty was obviously to change his plan of
action and make the town of Monteith the centre of his
inquiries. But he hesitated to do this till he had made one
other visit to the woods in whose recesses he still believed
the murderer to have plunged immediately upon
dealing the fatal blow.</p>

<p>He went by the way of the street railroad, not wishing
to be again seen crossing the bog, and arrived at the hut
in the centre of the glade without meeting any one or
experiencing the least adventure.</p>

<p>This time he went in, but nothing was to be seen save
bare logs, a rough hearth where a fire had once been
built, and the rudest sort of bench and table; and hurrying
forth again, he looked doubtfully up and down the
glade in pursuit of some hint to guide him in his future
researches.</p>

<p>Suddenly he received one. The thick wall of foliage
which at first glance revealed but the two outlets already
traversed by him, showed upon close inspection a third
path, opening well behind the hut, and leading, as he
soon discovered, in an entirely opposite direction from
that which had taken him to West Side. Merely stopping
to cast one glance at the sun, which was still well
overhead, he set out on this new path. It was longer and
much more intricate than the other. It led through hollows
and up steeps, and finally out into an open blackberry
patch, where it seemed to terminate. But a close
study of the surrounding bushes, soon disclosed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
signs of a narrow and thread-like passage curving about a
rocky steep. Entering this he presently found himself
drawn again into the woods, which he continued to traverse
till he came to a road cut through the heart of the
forest, for the use of the lumbermen. Here he paused.
Should he turn to the right or left? He decided to turn
to the right. Keeping in the road, which was rough with
stones where it was not marked with the hoofs of both
horses and cattle, he walked for some distance. Then he
emerged into open space again, and discovered that he
was on the hillside overlooking Monteith, and that by a
mile or two's further walk over the highway that was
dimly to be descried at the foot of the hill, he would
reach the small station devoted to the uses of the quarrymen
that worked in this place.</p>

<p>There was no longer any further doubt that this route,
and not the other, had been the one taken by Mr. Mansell
on that fatal afternoon. But he was determined not
to trust any further to mere surmises; so hastening down
the hill, he made his way in the direction of the highway,
meaning to take the walk alluded to, and learn for himself
what passengers had taken the train at this point on
the Tuesday afternoon so often mentioned.</p>

<p>But a barrier rose in his way. A stream which he had
barely noticed in the quick glance he threw over the landscape
from the brow of the hill, separated with quite a
formidable width of water the hillside from the road, and
it was not till he wandered back for some distance along<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
its banks, that he found a bridge. The time thus lost was
considerable, but he did not think of it; and when, after a
long and weary tramp, he stepped upon the platform of
the small station, he was so eager to learn if he had correctly
followed the scent, that he forgot to remark that
the road he had taken was any thing but an easy or
feasible one for a hasty escape.</p>

<p>The accommodation-trains, which alone stop at this
point, had both passed, and he found the station-master
at leisure. A single glance into his honest and intelligent
face convinced the detective that he had a reliable
man to deal with. He at once commenced his questions.</p>

<p>"Do many persons besides the quarrymen take the
train at this place?" asked he.</p>

<p>"Not many," was the short but sufficiently good-natured
rejoinder. "I guess I could easily count them
on the fingers of one hand," he laughed.</p>

<p>"You would be apt to notice, then, if a strange gentleman
got on board here at any time, would you not?"</p>

<p>"Guess so; not often troubled that way, but sometimes&mdash;sometimes."</p>

<p>"Can you tell me whether a young man of very dark
complexion, heavy mustache, and a determined, if not
excited, expression, took the cars here for Monteith, say,
any day last week?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," mused the man. "Dark complexion,
you say, large mustache; let me see."</p>

<p>"No dandy," Mr. Byrd carefully explained, "but a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
strong man, who believes in work. He was possibly in a
state of somewhat nervous hurry," he went on, suggestively,
"and if he wore an overcoat at all, it was a gray
one."</p>

<p>The face of the man lighted up.</p>

<p>"I seem to remember," said he. "Did he have a very
bright blue eye and a high color?"</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd nodded.</p>

<p>"And did he carry a peculiarly shaped bag, of which
he was very careful?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Mr. Byrd, but remembering the
model, added with quick assurance, "I have no doubt he
did"; which seemed to satisfy the other, for he at once
cried:</p>

<p>"I recollect such a person very well. I noticed him
before he got to the station; as soon in fact as he came
in sight. He was walking down the highway, and seemed
to be thinking about something. He's of the kind to
attract attention. What about him, sir?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. He was in trouble of some kind, and he
went from home without saying where he was going;
and his friends are anxious about him, that is all. Do
you think you could swear to his face if you saw it?"</p>

<p>"I think I could. He was the only stranger that got
on to the cars that afternoon."</p>

<p>"Do you remember, then, the day?"</p>

<p>"Well, no, now, I don't."</p>

<p>"But can't you, if you try? Wasn't there something
done by you that day which will assist your memory?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>Again that slow "Let me see" showed that the man
was pondering. Suddenly he slapped his thigh and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"You might be a lawyer's clerk now, mightn't you;
or, perhaps, a lawyer himself? I do remember that a
large load of stone was sent off that day, and a minute's
look at my book&mdash;&mdash; It was Tuesday," he presently
affirmed.</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd drew a deep breath. There is sadness mixed
with the satisfaction of such a triumph.</p>

<p>"I am much obliged to you," he said, in acknowledgment
of the other's trouble. "The friends of this gentleman
will now have little difficulty in tracing him. There
is but one thing further I should like to make sure of."</p>

<p>And taking from his memorandum-book the picture he
kept concealed there, he showed him the face of Mr.
Mansell, now altered to a perfect likeness, and asked him
if he recognized it.</p>

<p>The decided Yes which he received made further
questions unnecessary.</p>

<h3>STORM.</h3>

<div class='poem'>
Oh, my offence is rank, it smells to heav'n:<br />
It hath the primal eldest curse upon 't!&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hamlet.</span><br />
<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>A &nbsp;&nbsp;DAY had passed. Mr. Byrd, who no longer had
any reason to doubt that he was upon the trail of
the real assailant of the Widow Clemmens, had resolved
upon a third visit to the woods, this time with the
definite object of picking up any clew, however trifling,
in support of the fact that Craik Mansell had passed
through the glade behind his aunt's house.</div>

<p>The sky, when he left the hotel, was one vast field of
blue; but by the time he reached the terminus of the
car-route, and stepped out upon the road leading to the
woods, dark clouds had overcast the sun, and a cool
wind replaced the quiet zephyrs which had all day
fanned the brilliant autumn foliage.</p>

<p>He did not realize the condition of the atmosphere,
however, and proceeded on his way, thinking more of the
person he had just perceived issuing from the door-way of
Professor Darling's lofty mansion, than of the low mutterings
of distant thunder that now and then disturbed
the silence of the woods, or of the ominous, brazen tint
which was slowly settling over the huge bank of cloud<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
that filled the northern sky. For that person was Miss
Dare, and her presence here, or anywhere near him, at
this time, must of necessity, awaken a most painful train
of thought.</p>

<p>But, though unmindful of the storm, he was dimly
conscious of the darkness that was settling about him.
Quicker and quicker grew his pace, and at last he almost
broke into a run as the heavy pall of a large black cloud
swept up over the zenith, and wiped from the heavens
the last remnant of blue sky. One drop fell, then another,
then a slow, heavy patter, that bent double the
leaves they fell upon, as if a shower of lead had
descended upon the heavily writhing forest. The wind
had risen, too, and the vast aisles of that clear and
beautiful wood thundered with the swaying of boughs,
and the crash here and there of an old and falling limb.
But the lightning delayed.</p>

<p>The blindest or most abstracted man could be ignorant
no longer of what all this turmoil meant. Stopping in
the path along which he had been speeding, Mr. Byrd
glanced before him and behind, in a momentary calculation
of distances, and deciding he could not regain the
terminus before the storm burst, pushed on toward the
hut.</p>

<p>He reached it just as the first flash of lightning darted
down through the heavy darkness, and was about to
fling himself against the door, when something&mdash;was it
the touch of an invisible hand, or the crash of awful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
thunder which at this instant plowed up the silence of
the forest and woke a pandemonium of echoes about his
head?&mdash;stopped him.</p>

<p>He never knew. He only realized that he shuddered
and drew back, with a feeling of great disinclination to
enter the low building before him, alone; and that presently
taking advantage of another loud crash of falling
boughs, he crept around the corner of the hut, and satisfied
his doubts by looking into the small, square window
opening to the west.</p>

<p>He found there was ample reason for all the hesitation
he had felt. A man was sitting there, who, at the first
glimpse, appeared to him to be none other than Craik
Mansell. But reason soon assured him this could not be,
though the shape, the attitude&mdash;that old attitude of
despair which he remembered so well&mdash;was so startlingly
like that of the man whose name was uppermost in his
thoughts, that he recoiled in spite of himself.</p>

<p>A second flash swept blinding through the wood. Mr.
Byrd advanced his head and took another glance at the
stranger. It <i>was</i> Mr. Mansell. No other man would sit
so quiet and unmoved during the rush and clatter of a
terrible storm.</p>

<p>Look! not a hair of his head has stirred, not a movement
has taken place in the hands clasped so convulsively
beneath his brow. He is an image, a stone, and
would not hear though the roof fell in.</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd himself forgot the storm, and only queried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
what his duty was in this strange and surprising emergency.</p>

<p>But before he could come to any definite conclusion,
he was subjected to a new sensation. A stir that was not
the result of the wind or the rain had taken place in the
forest before him. A something&mdash;he could not tell what&mdash;was
advancing upon him from the path he had himself
travelled so short a time before, and its step, if step it
were, shook him with a vague apprehension that made
him dread to lift his eyes. But he conquered the unmanly
instinct, and merely taking the precaution to step
somewhat further back from view, looked in the direction
of his fears, and saw a tall, firmly-built woman, whose
grandly poised head, held high, in defiance of the gale,
the lightning, and the rain, proclaimed her to be none
other than Imogene Dare.</p>

<p>It was a juxtaposition of mental, moral, and physical
forces that almost took Mr. Byrd's breath away. He had
no doubt whom she had come to see, or to what sort of a
tryst he was about to be made an unwilling witness. But
he could not have moved if the blast then surging through
the trees had uprooted the huge pine behind which he
had involuntarily drawn at the first impression he had
received of her approach. He must watch that white
face of hers slowly evolve itself from the surrounding
darkness, and he must be present when the dreadful bolt
swept down from heaven, if only to see her eyes in the
flare of its ghostly flame.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>It came while she was crossing the glade. Fierce,
blinding, more vivid and searching than at any time
before, it flashed down through the cringing boughs, and,
like a mantle of fire, enveloped her form, throwing out
its every outline, and making of the strong and beautiful
face an electric vision which Mr. Byrd was never able to
forget.</p>

<p>A sudden swoop of wind followed, flinging her almost
to the ground, but Mr. Byrd knew from that moment that
neither wind nor lightning, not even the fear of death,
would stop this woman if once she was determined upon
any course.</p>

<p>Dreading the next few moments inexpressibly, yet
forcing himself, as a detective, to remain at his post,
though every instinct of his nature rebelled, Mr. Byrd
drew himself up against the side of the low hut and
listened. Her voice, rising between the mutterings of
thunder and the roar of the ceaseless gale, was plainly to
be heard.</p>

<p>"Craik Mansell," said she, in a strained tone, that was
not without its severity, "you sent for me, and I am
here."</p>

<p>Ah, this was her mode of greeting, was it? Mr. Byrd
felt his breath come easier, and listened for the reply
with intensest interest.</p>

<p>But it did not come. The low rumbling of the thunder
went on, and the wind howled through the gruesome
forest, but the man she had addressed did not speak.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>"Craik!" Her voice still came from the door-way,
where she had seemingly taken her stand. "Do you not
hear me?"</p>

<p>A stifled groan was the sole reply.</p>

<p>She appeared to take one step forward, but no more.</p>

<p>"I can understand," said she, and Mr. Byrd had no
difficulty in hearing her words, though the turmoil overhead
was almost deafening, "why the restlessness of
despair should drive you into seeking this interview. I
have longed to see you too, if only to tell you that I wish
heaven's thunderbolts had fallen upon us both on that
day when we sat and talked of our future prospects
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A lurid flash cut short her words. Strange and awesome
sounds awoke in the air above, and the next moment
a great branch fell crashing down upon the roof of the
hut, beating in one corner, and sliding thence heavily to
the ground, where it lay with all its quivering leaves
uppermost, not two feet from the door-way where this
woman stood.</p>

<p>A shriek like that of a lost spirit went up from her
lips.</p>

<p>"I thought the vengeance of heaven had fallen!" she
gasped. And for a moment not a sound was heard within
or without the hut, save that low flutter of the disturbed
leaves. "It is not to be," she then whispered, with a
return of her old calmness, that was worse than any
shriek. "Murder is not to be avenged thus." Then,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
shortly: "A dark and hideous line of blood is drawn
between you and me, Craik Mansell. <i>I</i> cannot pass it,
and you must not, forever and forever and forever. But
that does not hinder me from wishing to help you, and so
I ask, in all sincerity, What is it you want me to do for
you to-day?"</p>

<p>A response came this time.</p>

<p>"Show me how to escape the consequences of my
act," were his words, uttered in a low and muffled voice.</p>

<p>She did not answer at once.</p>

<p>"Are you threatened?" she inquired at last, in a tone
that proved she had drawn one step nearer to the bowed
form and hidden face of the person she addressed.</p>

<p>"My conscience threatens me," was the almost stifled
reply.</p>

<p>Again that heavy silence, all the more impressive that
the moments before had been so prolific of heaven's most
terrible noises.</p>

<p>"You suffer because another man is forced to endure
suspicion for a crime he never committed," she whisperingly
exclaimed.</p>

<p>Only a groan answered her; and the moments grew
heavier and heavier, more and more oppressive, though
the hitherto accompanying outcries of the forest had
ceased, and a faint lightening of the heavy darkness was
taking place overhead. Mr. Byrd felt the pressure of the
situation so powerfully, he drew near to the window he
had hitherto avoided, and looked in. She was standing a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
foot behind the crouched figure of the man, between
whom and herself she had avowed a line of blood to be
drawn. As he looked she spoke.</p>

<p>"Craik," said she, and the deathless yearning of love
spoke in her voice at last, "there is but one thing to do.
Expiate your guilt by acknowledging it. Save the innocent
from unmerited suspicion, and trust to the mercy
of God. It is the only advice I can give you. I know
no other road to peace. If I did&mdash;&mdash;" She stopped,
choked by the terror of her own thoughts. "Craik," she
murmured, at last, "on the day I hear of your having
made this confession, I vow to take an oath of celibacy
for life. It is the only recompense I can offer for the
misery and sin into which our mutual mad ambitions have
plunged you."</p>

<p>And subduing with a look of inexpressible anguish an
evident longing to lay her hand in final caress upon that
bended head, she gave him one parting look, and then,
with a quick shudder, hurried away, and buried herself
amid the darkness of the wet and shivering woods.</p>

<h3>A SURPRISE.</h3>

<div class='center'>
Season your admiration for awhile.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hamlet.</span><br />
<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>WHEN all was still again, Mr. Byrd advanced from
his place of concealment, and softly entered
the hut. Its solitary occupant sat as before, with his
head bent down upon his clasped hands. But at the first
sound of Mr. Byrd's approach he rose and turned. The
shock of the discovery which followed sent the detective
reeling back against the door. The person who faced
him with such quiet assurance was <i>not</i> Craik Mansell.</div>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<h3>A BRACE OF DETECTIVES.</h3>

<br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
No action, whether foul or fair,<br />

<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>"SO there are two of us! I thought as much when
I first set eyes upon your face in Buffalo!"</div>

<p>This exclamation, uttered in a dry and musing tone,
woke Mr. Byrd from the stupor into which this astonishing
discovery had thrown him. Advancing upon the
stranger, who in size, shape, and coloring was almost the
<i>fac-simile</i> of the person he had so successfully represented,
Mr. Byrd looked him scrutinizingly over.</p>

<p>The man bore the ordeal with equanimity; he even
smiled.</p>

<p>"You don't recognize me, I see."</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd at once recoiled.</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried he, "you are that Jack-in-the-box,
Brown!"</p>

<p>"<i>Alias</i> Frank Hickory, at your service."</p>

<p>This name, so unexpected, called up a flush of mingled
surprise and indignation to Mr. Byrd's cheek.</p>

<p>"I thought&mdash;&mdash;" he began<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>.</p>

<p>"Don't think," interrupted the other, who, when
excited, affected laconicism, "know." Then, with affability,
proceeded, "You are the gentleman&mdash;&mdash;" he paid
that much deference to Mr. Byrd's air and manner, "who
I was told might lend me a helping hand in this Clemmens
affair. I didn't recognize you before, sir. Wouldn't
have stood in your way if I had. Though, to be sure,
I did want to see this matter through myself. I thought
I had the right. And I've done it, too, as you must
acknowledge, if you have been present in this terrible
place very long."</p>

<p>This self-satisfied, if not boastful, allusion to a scene in
which this strange being had played so unworthy, if not
unjustifiable, a part, sent a thrill of revulsion through Mr.
Byrd. Drawing hastily back with an instinct of dislike
he could not conceal, he cast a glance through the thicket
of trees that spread beyond the open door, and pointedly
asked:</p>

<p>"Was there no way of satisfying yourself of the guilt of
Craik Mansell, except by enacting a farce that may lead
to the life-long remorse of the woman out of whose love
you have made a trap?"</p>

<p>A slow flush, the first, possibly, that had visited the
hardy cheek of this thick-skinned detective for years,
crept over the face of Frank Hickory.</p>

<p>"I don't mean she shall ever know," he sullenly protested,
kicking at the block upon which he had been sitting.
"But it <i>was</i> a mean trick," he frankly enough<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
admitted the next moment. "If I hadn't been the
tough old hickory knot that I am, I couldn't have done
it, I suppose. The storm, too, made it seem a bit trifling.
But&mdash;&mdash; Well, well!" he suddenly interjected, in a
more cheerful tone, "'tis too late now for tears and
repentance. The thing is done, and can't be undone.
And, at all events, I reckon we are both satisfied <i>now</i> as
to who killed Widow Clemmens!"</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd could not resist a slight sarcasm. "I thought
you were satisfied in that regard before?" said he. "At
least, I understood that at a certain time you were very
positive it was Mr. Hildreth."</p>

<p>"So I was," the fellow good-naturedly allowed; "so I
was. The byways of a crime like this are dreadful dark
and uncertain. It isn't strange that a fellow gets lost
sometimes. But I got a jog on my elbow that sent me
into the right path," said he, "as, perhaps, you did too,
sir, eh?"</p>

<p>Not replying to this latter insinuation, Mr. Byrd
quietly repeated:</p>

<p>"You got a jog on your elbow? When, may I ask?"</p>

<p>"Three days ago, <i>just!</i>" was the emphatic reply.</p>

<p>"And from whom?"</p>

<p>Instead of replying, the man leaned back against the
wall of the hut and looked at his interlocutor in silence.</p>

<p>"Are we going to join hands over this business?" he
cried, at last, "or are you thinking of pushing your way
on alone after you have got from me all that I know?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>The question took Mr. Byrd by surprise.</p>

<p>He had not thought of the future. He was as yet too
much disturbed by his memories of the past. To hide
his discomfiture, he began to pace the floor, an operation
which his thoroughly wet condition certainly made
advisable.</p>

<p>"I have no wish to rob you of any glory you may hope
to reap from the success of the plot you have carried on
here to-day," he presently declared, with some bitterness;
"but if this Craik Mansell <i>is</i> guilty, I suppose it
is my duty to help you in the collection of all suitable
and proper evidence against him."</p>

<p>"Then," said the other, who had been watching him
with rather an anxious eye, "let us to work." And, sitting
down on the table, he motioned to Mr. Byrd to take
a seat upon the block at his side.</p>

<p>But the latter kept up his walk.</p>

<p>Hickory surveyed him for a moment in silence, then he
said:</p>

<p>"You must have something against this young man, or
you wouldn't be here. What is it? What first set you
thinking about Craik Mansell?"</p>

<p>Now, this was a question Mr. Byrd could not and
would not answer. After what had just passed in the
hut, he felt it impossible to mention to this man the name
of Imogene Dare in connection with that of the nephew
of Mrs. Clemmens. He therefore waived the other's
interrogation and remarked:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>"My knowledge was rather the fruit of surmise than
fact. I did not believe in the guilt of Gouverneur Hildreth,
and so was forced to look about me for some one
whom I could conscientiously suspect. I fixed upon this
unhappy man in Buffalo; how truly, your own suspicions,
unfortunately, reveal."</p>

<p>"And I had to have my wits started by a horrid old
woman," murmured the evidently abashed Hickory.</p>

<p>"Horrid old woman!" repeated Mr. Byrd. "Not
Sally Perkins?"</p>

<p>"Yes. A sweet one, isn't she?"</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd shuddered.</p>

<p>"Tell me about it," said he, coming and sitting down
in the seat the other had previously indicated to him.</p>

<p>"I will, sir; I will: but first let's look at the weather.
Some folks would think it just as well for you to change
that toggery of yours. What do you say to going home
first, and talking afterward?"</p>

<p>"I suppose it would be wise," admitted Mr. Byrd,
looking down at his garments, whose decidedly damp
condition he had scarcely noticed in his excitement.
"And yet I hate to leave this spot till I learn how you
came to choose it as the scene of the tragi-comedy you
have enacted here to-day, and what position it is likely
to occupy in the testimony which you have collected
against this young man."</p>

<p>"Wait, then," said the bustling fellow, "till I build you
the least bit of a fire to warm you. It won't take but a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
minute," he averred, piling together some old sticks that
cumbered the hearth, and straightway setting a match to
them. "See! isn't that pleasant? And now, just cast
your eye at this!" he continued, drawing a comfortable-looking
flask out of his pocket and handing it over to
the other with a dry laugh. "Isn't <i>this</i> pleasant?" And
he threw himself down on the floor and stretched out his
hands to the blaze, with a gusto which the dreary hour
he had undoubtedly passed made perfectly natural, if not
excusable.</p>

<p>"I thank you," said Mr. Byrd; "I didn't know I was
so chilled," and he, too, enjoyed the warmth. "And,
now," he pursued, after a moment, "go on; let us have
the thing out at once."</p>

<p>But the other was in no hurry. "Very good, sir," he
cried; "but, first, if you don't mind, suppose you tell me
what brought <i>you</i> to this hut to-day?"</p>

<p>"I was on the look-out for clues. In my study of the
situation, I decided that the murderer of Mrs. Clemmens
escaped, not from the front, but from the back, of the
house. Taking the path I imagined him to have trod, I
came upon this hut. It naturally attracted my attention,
and to-day I came back to examine it more closely in the
hope of picking up some signs of his having been here,
or at least of having passed through the glade on his
way to the deeper woods."</p>

<p>"And what, if you had succeeded in this, sir? What,
if some token of his presence had rewarded your search?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should have completed a chain of proof of which
only this one link is lacking. I could have shown how
Craik Mansell fled from this place on last Tuesday afternoon,
making his way through the woods to the highway,
and thence to the Quarry Station at Monteith, where he
took the train which carried him back to Buffalo."</p>

<p>"You could!&mdash;show me how?"</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd explained himself more definitely.</p>

<p>Hickory at once rose.</p>

<p>"I guess we can give you the link," he dryly remarked.
"At all events, suppose you just step here and tell me
what conclusion you draw from the appearance of this
pile of brush."</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd advanced and looked at a small heap of
hemlock that lay in a compact mass in one corner.</p>

<p>"I have not disturbed it," pursued the other. "It is
just as it was when I found it."</p>

<p>"Looks like a pillow," declared Mr. Byrd. "Has
been used for such, I am sure; for see, the dust in this
portion of the floor lies lighter than elsewhere. You can
almost detect the outline of a man's recumbent form," he
went on, slowly, leaning down to examine the floor more
closely. "As for the boughs, they have been cut from
the tree with a knife, and&mdash;&mdash;" Lifting up a sprig, he
looked at it, then passed it over to Hickory, with a
meaning glance that directed attention to one or two
short hairs of a dark brown color, that were caught in
the rough bark. "He did not even throw his pocket-handkerchief<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
over the heap before lying down," he
observed.</p>

<p>Mr. Hickory smiled. "You're up in your business, I
see." And drawing his new colleague to the table, he
asked him what he saw there.</p>

<p>At first sight Mr. Byrd exclaimed: "Nothing," but in
another moment he picked up an <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'infinitesmal'">infinitesimal</ins> chip from
between the rough logs that formed the top of this somewhat
rustic piece of furniture, and turning it over in his
hand, pronounced it to be a piece of wood from a lead-pencil.</p>

<p>"Here are several of them," remarked Mr. Hickory,
"and what is more, it is easy to tell just the color
of the pencil from which they were cut. It was blue."</p>

<p>"That is so," assented Mr. Byrd.</p>

<p>"Quarrymen, charcoal-burners, and the like are not
much in the habit of sharpening pencils," suggested
Hickory.</p>

<p>"Is the pencil now to be found in the pocket of Mr.
Mansell a blue one?"</p>

<p>"It is."</p>

<p>"Have you any thing more to show me?" asked Mr.
Byrd.</p>

<p>"Only this," responded the other, taking out of his
pocket the torn-off corner of a newspaper. "I found
this blowing about under the bushes out there," said he.
"Look at it and tell me from what paper it was torn."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Mr. Byrd; "none that I am
acquainted with."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>"You don't read the Buffalo <i>Courier?</i>"</p>

<p>"Oh, is this&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A corner from the Buffalo <i>Courier?</i> I don't know,
but I mean to find out. If it is, and the date proves to
be correct, we won't have much trouble about the little
link, will we?"</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd shook his head and they again crouched
down over the fire.</p>

<p>"And, now, what did you learn in Buffalo?" inquired
the persistent Hickory.</p>

<p>"Not much," acknowledged Mr. Byrd. "The man
Brown was entirely too ubiquitous to give me my full
chance. Neither at the house nor at the mill was I able
to glean any thing beyond an admission from the landlady
that Mr. Mansell was not at home at the time of his
aunt's murder. I couldn't even learn where he was on
that day, or where he had ostensibly gone? If it had
not been for the little girl of Mr. Goodman&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, I had not time to go to that house," interjected
the other, suggestively.</p>

<p>"I should have come home as wise as I went," continued
Mr. Byrd. "She told me that on the day before
Mr. Mansell returned, he wrote to her father from Monteith,
and <i>that</i> settled my mind in regard to him. It was
pure luck, however."</p>

<p>The other laughed long and loud.</p>

<p>"I didn't know I did it up so well," he cried. "I
told the landlady you were a detective, or acted like one,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
and she was very ready to take the alarm, having, as I
judge, a motherly liking for her young boarder. Then I
took Messrs. Chamberlin and Harrison into my confidence,
and having got from them all the information
they could give me, told them there was evidently
another man on the track of this Mansell, and warned
them to keep silence till they heard from the prosecuting
attorney in Sibley. But I didn't know who you were, or,
at least, I wasn't sure; or, as I said before, I shouldn't
have presumed."</p>

<p>The short, dry laugh with which he ended this explanation
had not ceased, when Mr. Byrd observed:</p>

<p>"You have not told me what <i>you</i> gathered in Buffalo."</p>

<p>"Much," quoth Hickory, reverting to his favorite
laconic mode of speech. "First, that Mansell went
from home on Monday, the day before the murder, for
the purpose, as he said, of seeing a man in New York
about his wonderful invention. Secondly, that he never
went to New York, but came back the next evening,
bringing his model with him, and looking terribly used
up and worried. Thirdly, that to get this invention
before the public had been his pet aim and effort for a
whole year. That he believed in it as you do in your
Bible, and would have given his heart's blood, if it would
have done any good, to start the thing, and prove himself
right in his estimate of its value. That the money to
do this was all that was lacking, no one believing in him
sufficiently to advance him the five thousand dollars considered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
necessary to build the machine and get it in working
order. That, in short, he was a fanatic on the subject,
and often said he would be willing to die within the
year if he could first prove to the unbelieving capitalists
whom he had vainly importuned for assistance, the worth
of the discovery he believed himself to have made.
Fourthly&mdash;but what is it you wish to say, sir?"</p>

<p>"Five thousand dollars is just the amount Widow Clemmens
is supposed to leave him," remarked Mr. Byrd.</p>

<p>"Precisely," was the short reply.</p>

<p>"And fourthly?" suggested the former.</p>

<p>"Fourthly, he was in the mill on Wednesday morning,
where he went about his work as usual, until some one
who knew his relation to Mrs. Clemmens looked up from the
paper he was reading, and, in pure thoughtlessness, cried,
'So they have killed your aunt for you, have they?' A
barbarous jest, that caused everybody near him to start in
indignation, but which made him recoil as if one of these
thunderbolts we have been listening to this afternoon had
fallen at his feet. And he didn't get over it," Hickory
went on. "He had to beg permission to go home. He
said the terrible news had made him ill, and indeed he
looked sick enough, and continued to look sick enough
for days. He had letters from Sibley, and an invitation
to attend the inquest and be present at the funeral
services, but he refused to go. He was threatened with
diphtheria, he declared, and remained away from the mill
until the day before yesterday. Some one, I don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
remember who, says he went out of town the very Wednesday
he first heard the news; but if so, he could
not have been gone long, for he was at home Wednesday
night, sick in bed, and threatened, as I have said, with
the diphtheria. Fifthly&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, fifthly?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid of your criticisms," laughed the rough
detective. "Fifthly is the result of my poking about
among Mr. Mansell's traps."</p>

<p>"Ah!" frowned the other, with a vivid remembrance
of that picture of Miss Dare, with its beauty blotted out
by the ominous black lines.</p>

<p>"You are too squeamish for a detective," the other
declared. "Guess you're kept for the fancy business,
eh?"</p>

<p>The look Mr. Byrd gave him was eloquent. "Go on,"
said he; "let us hear what lies behind your fifthly."</p>

<p>"Love," returned the man. "Locked in the drawer of
this young gentleman's table, I found some half-dozen
letters tied with a black ribbon. I knew they were
written by a lady, but squeamishness is not a fault
of mine, and so I just allowed myself to glance over them.
They were from Miss Dare, of course, and they revealed
the fact that love, as well as ambition, had been a motive
power in determining this Mansell to make a success
out of his invention."</p>

<p>Leaning back, the now self-satisfied detective looked
at Mr. Byrd.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>"The name of Miss Dare," he went on, "brings me to
the point from which we started. I haven't yet told
you what old Sally Perkins had to say to me."</p>

<p>"No," rejoined Mr. Byrd.</p>

<p>"Well," continued the other, poking with his foot the
dying embers of the fire, till it started up into a fresh
blaze, "the case against this young fellow wouldn't be
worth very much without that old crone's testimony,
I reckon; but with it I guess we can get along."</p>

<p>"Let us hear," said Mr. Byrd.</p>

<p>"The old woman is a wretch," Hickory suddenly
broke out. "She seems to gloat over the fact that
a young and beautiful woman is in trouble. She actually
trembled with eagerness as she told her story. If I
hadn't been rather anxious myself to hear what she had
to say, I could have thrown her out of the window.
As it was, I let her go on; duty before pleasure, you see&mdash;duty
before pleasure."</p>

<p>"But her story," persisted Mr. Byrd, letting some
of his secret irritation betray itself.</p>

<p>"Well, her story was this: Monday afternoon, the day
before the murder, you know, she was up in these very
woods hunting for witch-hazel. She had got her arms
full and was going home across the bog when she suddenly
heard voices. Being of a curious disposition, like myself,
I suppose, she stopped, and seeing just before her
a young gentleman and lady sitting on an old stump,
crouched down in the shadow of a tree, with the harmless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
intent, no doubt, of amusing herself with their conversation.
It was more interesting than she expected,
and she really became quite tragic as she related her
story to me. I cannot do justice to it myself, and I
sha'n't try. It is enough that the man whom she did
not know, and the woman whom she immediately recognized
as Miss Dare, were both in a state of great indignation.
That he spoke of selfishness and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'obstancy'">obstinacy</ins> on
the part of his aunt, and that she, in the place of rebuking
him, replied in a way to increase his bitterness, and lead
him finally to exclaim: 'I cannot bear it! To think that
with just the advance of the very sum she proposes to
give me some day, I could make her fortune and my own,
and win <i>you</i> all in one breath! It is enough to drive a
man mad to see all that he craves in this world so near
his grasp, and yet have nothing, not even hope, to comfort
him.' And at that, it seems, they both rose, and she,
who had not answered any thing to this, struck the tree
before which they stood, with her bare fist, and murmured
a word or so which the old woman couldn't catch, but
which was evidently something to the effect that she
wished she knew Mrs. Clemmens; for Mansell&mdash;of
course it was he&mdash;said, in almost the same breath, 'And
if you did know her, what then?' A question which
elicited no reply at first, but which finally led her to say:
'Oh! I think that, possibly, I might be able to persuade
her.' All this," the detective went on, "old Sally related
with the greatest force; but in regard to what followed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
she was not so clear. Probably they interrupted
their conversation with some lovers' by-play, for they
stood very near together, and he seemed to be earnestly
pleading with her. 'Do take it,' old Sally heard him
say. 'I shall feel as if life held some outlook for
me, if you only will gratify me in this respect.' But
she answered: 'No; it is of no use. I am as
ambitious as you are, and fate is evidently against
us,' and put his hand back when he endeavored to take
hers, but finally yielded so far as to give it to him for a
moment, though she immediately snatched it away again,
crying: 'I cannot; you must wait till to-morrow.' And
when he asked: 'Why to-morrow?' she answered: 'A
night has been known to change the whole current of a
person's affairs.' To which he replied: 'True,' and
looked thoughtful, very thoughtful, as he met her eyes
and saw her raise that white hand of hers and strike the
tree again with a passionate force that made her fingers
bleed. And she was right," concluded the speaker.
"The night, or if not the night, the next twenty-four
hours, <i>did</i> make a change, as even old Sally Perkins
observed. Widow Clemmens was struck down and Craik
Mansell became the possessor of the five thousand dollars
he so much wanted in order to win for himself a fortune
and a bride."</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd, who had been sitting with his face turned
aside during this long recital, slowly rose to his feet.
"Hickory," said he, and his tone had an edge of suppressed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
feeling in it that made the other start, "don't
let me ever hear you say, in my presence, that you think
this young and beautiful woman was the one to suggest
murder to this man, for I won't hear it. And now," he
continued, more calmly, "tell me why this babbling old
wretch did not enliven the inquest with her wonderful
tale. It would have been a fine offset to the testimony
of Miss Firman."</p>

<p>"She said she wasn't fond of coroners and had no
wish to draw the attention of twelve of her own townsfolk
upon herself. She didn't mean to commit herself with
me," pursued Hickory, rising also. "She was going to
give me a hint of the real state of affairs; or, rather, set
me working in the right direction, as this little note which
she tucked under the door of my room at the hotel will
show. But I was too quick for her, and had her by the
arm before she could shuffle down the stairs. It was
partly to prove her story was true and not a romance
made up for the occasion, that I lured this woman here
this afternoon."</p>

<p>"You are not as bad a fellow as I thought," Mr. Byrd
admitted, after a momentary contemplation of the
other's face. "If I might only know how you managed
to effect this interview."</p>

<p>"Nothing easier. I found in looking over the scraps
of paper which Mansell had thrown into the waste-paper
basket in Buffalo, the draft of a note which he had written
to Miss Dare, under an impulse which he afterward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
probably regretted. It was a summons to their usual
place of tryst at or near this hut, and though unsigned,
was of a character, as I thought, to effect its purpose. I
just sent it to her, that's all."</p>

<p>The nonchalance with which this was said completed
Mr. Byrd's astonishment.</p>

<p>"You are a worthy disciple of Gryce," he asserted, leading
the way to the door.</p>

<p>"Think so?" exclaimed the man, evidently flattered
at what he considered a great compliment. "Then shake
hands," he cried, with a frank appeal Mr. Byrd found it
hard to resist. "Ah, you don't want to," he somewhat
ruefully declared. "Will it change your feelings any if I
promise to ignore what happened here to-day&mdash;my trick
with Miss Dare and what she revealed and all that? If
it will, I swear I won't even think of it any more if I can
help it. At all events, I won't tattle about it even to the
superintendent. It shall be a secret between you and me,
and she won't know but what it was her lover she talked
to, after all."</p>

<p>"You are willing to do all this?" inquired Mr. Byrd.</p>

<p>"Willing and ready," cried the man. "I believe in
duty to one's superiors, but duty doesn't always demand
of one to tell every thing he knows. Besides, it won't be
necessary, I imagine. There is enough against this poor
fellow without that."</p>

<p>"I fear so," ejaculated Mr. Byrd.</p>

<p>"Then it is a bargain?" said Hickory.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>And Mr. Byrd held out his hand.</p>

<p>The rain had now ceased and they prepared to return
home. Before leaving the glade, however, Mr. Byrd ran
his eye over the other's person and apparel, and in some
wonder inquired:</p>

<p>"How do you fellows ever manage to get up such complete
disguises? I declare you look enough like Mr.
Mansell in the back to make me doubt even now who I
am talking to."</p>

<p>"Oh," laughed the other, "it is easy enough. It's my
specialty, you see, and one in which I <i>am</i> thought to
excel. But, to tell the truth, I hadn't much to contend
with in this case. In build I am famously like this man,
as you must have noticed when you saw us together in
Buffalo. Indeed, it was our similarity in this respect that
first put the idea of personifying him into my head. My
complexion had been darkened already, and, as for such
accessories as hair, voice, manner, dress, etc., a five-minutes'
study of my model was sufficient to prime me up in
all that&mdash;enough, at least, to satisfy the conditions of an
interview which did not require me to show my face."</p>

<p>"But you did not know when you came here that you
would not have to show your face," persisted Mr. Byrd,
anxious to understand how this man dared risk his reputation
on an undertaking of this kind.</p>

<p>"No, and I did not know that the biggest thunderstorm
of the season was going to spring up and lend me its darkness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
to complete the illusion I had attempted. I only
trusted my good fortune&mdash;and my wits," he added, with a
droll demureness. "Both had served me before, and
both were likely to serve me again. And, say she had
detected me in my little game, what then? Women like
her don't babble."</p>

<p>There was no reply to make to this, and Mr. Byrd's
thoughts being thus carried back to Imogene Dare and the
unhappy revelations she had been led to make, he walked
on in a dreary silence his companion had sufficient discretion
not to break.</p>

<h2>XIX.</h2>

<h3>MR. FERRIS.</h3>

<div class='poem'>
Which of you have done this?&mdash;<span class="smcap">Macbeth.</span><br />
What have we here?&mdash;<span class="smcap">Tempest.</span><br />
<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>MR. FERRIS sat in his office in a somewhat
gloomy frame of mind. There had been bad
news from the jail that morning. Mr. Hildreth had
attempted suicide the night before, and was now lying in
a critical condition at the hospital.</div>

<p>Mr. Ferris himself had never doubted this man's guilt.
From Hildreth's first appearance at the inquest, the
District Attorney had fixed upon him as the murderer of
Mrs. Clemmens, and up to this time he had seen no good
and substantial reason for altering his opinion.</p>

<p>Even the doubts expressed by Mr. Byrd had moved
him but little. Mr. Byrd was an enthusiast, and, naturally
enough, shrank from believing a gentleman capable of
such a crime. But the other detective's judgment was unswayed,
and he considered Hildreth guilty. It was not
astonishing, then, that the opinion of Mr. Ferris should
coincide with that of the older and more experienced
man.</p>

<p>But the depth of despair or remorse which had led Mr.
Hildreth to this desperate attempt upon his own life had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
struck the District Attorney with dismay. Though not
over-sensitive by nature, he could not help feeling sympathy
for the misery that had prompted such a deed, and
while secretly regarding this unsuccessful attempt at
suicide as an additional proof of guilt, he could not forbear
satisfying himself by a review of the evidence elicited
at the inquest, that the action of the authorities in
arresting this man had been both warrantable and necessary.</p>

<p>The result was satisfactory in all but one point. When
he came to the widow's written accusation against one by
the name of Gouverneur Hildreth, he was impressed by a
fact that had hitherto escaped his notice. This was the
yellowness of the paper upon which the words were
written. If they had been transcribed a dozen years before,
they would not have looked older, nor would the
ink have presented a more faded appearance. Now, as
the suspected man was under twenty-five years of age,
and must, therefore, have been a mere child when the
paper was drawn up, the probability was that the Gouverneur
intended was the prisoner's father, their names being
identical.</p>

<p>But this discovery, while it robbed the affair of its most
dramatic feature, could not affect in any serious way the
extreme significance of the remaining real and compromising
facts which told so heavily against this unfortunate
man. Indeed, the well-known baseness of the father
made it easier to distrust the son, and Mr. Ferris had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
just come to the conclusion that his duty compelled him
to draw up an indictment of the would-be suicide, when
the door opened, and Mr. Byrd and Mr. Hickory came in.</p>

<p>To see these two men in conjunction was a surprise to
the District Attorney. He, however, had no time to
express himself on the subject, for Mr. Byrd, stepping
forward, immediately remarked:</p>

<p>"Mr. Hickory and I have been in consultation, sir;
and we have a few facts to give you that we think will
alter your opinion as to the person who murdered Mrs.
Clemmens."</p>

<p>"Is this so?" cried Mr. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Ferrris'">Ferris</ins>, looking at Hickory
with a glance indicative of doubt.</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>sir</i>," exclaimed that not easily abashed individual,
with an emphasis decided enough to show the state
of his feelings on the subject. "After I last saw you a
woman came in my way and put into my hands so fresh
and promising a clue, that I dropped the old scent at
once and made instanter for the new game. But I soon
found I was not the only sportsman on this trail. Before
I had taken a dozen steps I ran upon this gentleman, and,
finding him true grit, struck up a partnership with him
that has led to our bringing down the quarry together."</p>

<p>"Humph!" quoth the District Attorney. "Some very
remarkable discoveries must have come to light to influence
the judgment of two such men as yourselves."</p>

<p>"You are right," rejoined Mr. Byrd. "In fact, I
should not be surprised if this case proved to be one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
the most remarkable on record. It is not often that
equally convincing evidence of guilt is found against two
men having no apparent connection."</p>

<p>"And have you collected such evidence?"</p>

<p>"We have."</p>

<p>"And who is the person you consider equally open to
suspicion with Mr. Hildreth?"</p>

<p>"Craik Mansell, Mrs. Clemmens' nephew."</p>

<p>The surprise of the District-Attorney was, as Mr.
Hickory in later days remarked, nuts to him. The solemn
nature of the business he was engaged upon never disturbed
this hardy detective's sense of the ludicrous, and
he indulged in one of his deepest chuckles as he met the
eye of Mr. Ferris.</p>

<p>"One never knows what they are going to run upon in
a chase of this kind, do they, sir?" he remarked, with the
greatest cheerfulness. "Mr. Mansell is no more of a
gentleman than Mr. Hildreth; yet, because he is the
second one of his caste who has attracted our attention,
you are naturally very much surprised. But wait till you
hear what we have to tell you. I am confident you will
be satisfied with our reasons for suspecting this new
party." And he glanced at Mr. Byrd, who, seeing no
cause for delay, proceeded to unfold before the District
Attorney the evidence they had collected against Mr.
Mansell.</p>

<p>It was strong, telling, and seemingly conclusive, as we
already know; and awoke in the mind of Mr. Ferris the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
greatest perplexity of his life. It was not simply that the
facts urged against Mr. Mansell were of the same circumstantial
character and of almost the same significance as
those already urged against Mr. Hildreth, but that the
association of Miss Dare's name with this new theory of
suspicion presented difficulties, if it did not involve consequences,
calculated to make any friend of Mr. Orcutt
quail. And Mr. Ferris was such a friend, and knew very
well the violent nature of the shock which this eminent
lawyer would experience at discovering the relations held
by this trusted woman toward a man suspected of crime.</p>

<p>Then Miss Dare herself! Was this beautiful and
cherished woman, hitherto believed by all who knew her
to be set high above the reach of reproach, to be dragged
down from her pedestal and submitted to the curiosity of
the rabble, if not to its insinuations and reproach? It
seemed hard; even to this stern, dry searcher among
dead men's bones, it seemed both hard and bitter. And
yet, because he was an honest man, he had no thought of
paltering with his duty. He could only take time to
make sure what that duty was. He accordingly refrained
from expressing any opinion in regard to Mr. Mansell's
culpability to the two detectives, and finally dismissed
them without any special orders.</p>

<p>But a day or two after this he sent for them again, and
said:</p>

<p>"Since I have seen you I have considered, with due
carefulness, the various facts presented me in support of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
your belief that Craik Mansell is the man who assailed
the Widow Clemmens, and have weighed them against the
equally significant facts pointing toward Mr. Hildreth as
the guilty party, and find but one link lacking in the
former chain of evidence which is not lacking in the latter;
and that is this: Mrs. Clemmens, in the one or two
lucid moments which returned to her after the assault,
gave utterance to an exclamation which many think was
meant to serve as a guide in determining the person of
her murderer. She said, 'Ring,' as Mr. Byrd here will
doubtless remember, and then 'Hand,' as if she wished to
fix upon the minds of those about her that the hand
uplifted against her wore a ring. At all events, such a
conclusion is plausible enough, and led to my making an
experiment yesterday, which has, for ever, set the matter
at rest in my own mind. I took my stand at the huge
clock in her house, just in the attitude she was supposed
to occupy when struck, and, while in this position, ordered
my clerk to advance upon me from behind with his hands
clasped about a stick of wood, which he was to bring
down within an inch of my head. This was done, and
while his arm was in the act of descending, I looked to
see if by a quick glance from the corner of my eye I
could detect the broad seal ring I had previously pushed
upon his little finger. I discovered that I could; that
indeed it was all of the man which I could distinctly see
without turning my head completely around. The ring,
then, is an important feature in this case, a link without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
which any chain of evidence forged for the express purpose
of connecting a man with this murder must necessarily
remain incomplete and consequently useless. But
amongst the suspicious circumstances brought to bear
against Mr. Mansell, I discern no token of a connection
between him and any such article, while we all know that
Mr. Hildreth not only wore a ring on the day of the
murder, but considered the circumstance so much in his
own disfavor, that he slipped it off his finger when he
began to see the shadow of suspicion falling upon him."</p>

<p>"You have, then, forgotten the diamond I picked up
from the floor of Mrs. Clemmens' dining-room on the
morning of the murder?" suggested Mr. Byrd with great
reluctance.</p>

<p>"No," answered the District Attorney, shortly. "But
Miss Dare distinctly avowed that ring to be hers, and
you have brought me no evidence as yet to prove her
statement false. If you can supply such proof, or if you
can show that Mr. Mansell had that ring on his hand
when he entered Mrs. Clemmens' house on the fatal
morning&mdash;another fact, which, by-the-way, rests as yet
upon inference only&mdash;I shall consider the case against
him as strong as that against Mr. Hildreth; otherwise,
not."</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd, with the vivid remembrance before him
of Miss Dare's looks and actions in the scene he had
witnessed between her and the supposed Mansell in the
hut, smiled with secret bitterness over this attempt of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
the District Attorney to shut his eyes to the evident
guiltiness of this man.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris saw this smile and instantly became irritated.</p>

<p>"I do not doubt any more than yourself," he resumed,
in a changed voice, "that this young man allowed his
mind to dwell upon the possible advantages which might
accrue to himself if his aunt should die. He may even
have gone so far as to meditate the commission of a crime
to insure these advantages. But whether the crime which
did indeed take place the next day in his aunt's house
was the result of his meditations, or whether he found his
own purpose forestalled by an attack made by another
person possessing no less interest than himself in seeing
this woman dead, is not determined by the evidence you
bring."</p>

<p>"Then you do not favor his arrest?" inquired Mr.
Byrd.</p>

<p>"No. The vigorous measures which were taken in
Mr. Hildreth's case, and the unfortunate event to which
they have led, are terrible enough to satisfy the public
craving after excitement for a week at least. I am not
fond of driving men to madness myself, and unless I can
be made to see that my duty demands a complete transferal
of my suspicions from Hildreth to Mansell, I can
advise nothing more than a close but secret surveillance
of the latter's movements until the action of the Grand
Jury determines whether the evidence against Mr.
Hildreth is sufficient to hold him for trial."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Byrd, who had such solid, if private and uncommunicable,
reasons for believing in the guilt of Craik
Mansell, was somewhat taken aback at this unlooked-for
decision of Mr. Ferris, and, remembering the temptation
which a man like Hickory must feel to make his cause
good at all hazards, cast a sharp look toward that blunt-spoken
detective, in some doubt as to whether he could
be relied upon to keep his promise in the face of this
manifest disappointment.</p>

<p>But Hickory had given his word, and Hickory remained
firm; and Mr. Byrd, somewhat relieved in his own
mind, was about to utter his acquiescence in the District
Attorney's views, when a momentary interruption
occurred, which gave him an opportunity to exchange
a few words aside with his colleague.</p>

<p>"Hickory," he whispered, "what do you think of this
objection which Mr. Ferris makes?"</p>

<p>"I?" was the hurried reply. "Oh, I think there is
something in it."</p>

<p>"Something in it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Mr. Mansell is the last man to wear a ring,
I must acknowledge. Indeed, I took some pains while in
Buffalo to find out if he ever indulged in any such vanity,
and was told decidedly No. As to the diamond you
mentioned, that is certainly entirely too rich a jewel for a
man like him to possess. I&mdash;I am a afraid the absence
of this link in our chain of evidence is fatal.
I shouldn't wonder if the old scent was the best,
after all."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>


<p>"But Miss Dare&mdash;her feelings and her convictions, as
manifested by the words she made use of in the hut?"
objected Mr. Byrd.</p>

<p>"Oh! <i>she</i> thinks he is guilty, of course!"</p>

<p><i>She</i> thinks! Mr. Byrd stared at his companion for a
minute in silence. <i>She</i> thinks! Then there was a possibility,
it seems, that it was only her thought, and that
Mr. Mansell was not really the culpable man he had been
brought to consider him.</p>

<p>But here an exclamation, uttered by Mr. Ferris, called
their attention back to that gentleman. He was reading
a letter which had evidently been just brought in, and his
expression was one of amazement, mixed with doubt. As
they looked toward him they met his eye, that had a
troubled and somewhat abashed expression, which convinced
them that the communication he held in his hand
was in some way connected with the matter under consideration.</p>

<p>Surprised themselves, they unconsciously started forward,
when, in a dry and not altogether pleased tone, the
District Attorney observed:</p>

<p>"This affair seems to be full of coincidences. You
talk of a missing link, and it is immediately thrust under
your nose. Read that!"</p>

<p>And he pushed toward them the following epistle,
roughly scrawled on a sheet of common writing-paper:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>If Mr. Ferris is anxious for justice, and can believe that suspicion
does not always attach itself to the guilty, let him, or some one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
whose business it is, inquire of Miss Imogene Dare, of this town, how
she came to claim as her own the ring that was picked up on the floor
of Mrs. Clemmens' house.</p></div>

<p>"Well!" cried Mr. Byrd, glancing at Hickory, "what
are we to think of this?"</p>

<p>"Looks like the work of old Sally Perkins," observed
the other, pointing out the lack of date and signature.</p>

<p>"So it does," acquiesced Mr. Byrd, in a relieved tone.
"The miserable old wretch is growing impatient."</p>

<p>But Mr. Ferris, with a gloomy frown, shortly said:</p>

<p>"The language is not that of an ignorant old creature
like Sally Perkins, whatever the writing may be. Besides,
how could she have known about the ring? The persons
who were present at the time it was picked up are not of
the gossiping order."</p>

<p>"Who, then, do you think wrote this?" inquired Mr.
Byrd.</p>

<p>"That is what I wish you to find out," declared the
District Attorney.</p>

<p>Mr. Hickory at once took it in his hand.</p>

<p>"Wait," said he, "I have an idea." And he carried
the letter to one side, where he stood examining it for
several minutes. When he came back he looked tolerably
excited and somewhat pleased. "I believe I can tell you
who wrote it," said he.</p>

<p>"Who?" inquired the District Attorney.</p>

<p>For reply the detective placed his finger upon a name
that was written in the letter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>


<p>"Imogene Dare?" exclaimed Mr. Ferris, astonished.</p>

<p>"She herself," proclaimed the self-satisfied detective.</p>

<p>"What makes you think that?" the District Attorney
slowly asked.</p>

<p>"Because I have seen her writing, and studied her signature,
and, ably as she has disguised her hand in the
rest of the letter, it betrays itself in her name. See here."
And Hickory took from his pocket-book a small slip of
paper containing her autograph, and submitted it to the
test of comparison.</p>

<p>The similarity between the two signatures was evident,
and both Mr. Byrd and Mr. Ferris were obliged to allow
the detective might be right, though the admission opened
up suggestions of the most formidable character.</p>

<p>"It is a turn for which I am not prepared," declared
the District Attorney.</p>

<p>"It is a turn for which <i>we</i> are not prepared," repeated
Mr. Byrd, with a controlling look at Hickory.</p>

<p>"Let us, then, defer further consideration of the matter
till I have had an opportunity to see Miss Dare," suggested
Mr. Ferris.</p>

<p>And the two detectives were very glad to acquiesce in
this, for they were as much astonished as he at this action
of Miss Dare, though, with their better knowledge of her
feelings, they found it comparatively easy to understand
how her remorse and the great anxiety she doubtless felt
for Mr. Hildreth had sufficed to drive her to such an
extreme and desperate measure.</p>

<div class='cap'>THAT my readers may understand even better than
Byrd and Hickory how it was that Imogene came
to write this letter, I must ask them to consider certain
incidents that had occurred in a quarter far removed
from the eye of the detectives.</div>

<p>Mr. Orcutt's mind had never been at rest concerning
the peculiar attitude assumed by Imogene Dare at the
time of Mrs. Clemmens' murder. Time and thought had
not made it any more possible for him to believe now
than then that she knew any thing of the matter beyond
what appeared to the general eye: but he could not
forget the ring. It haunted him. Fifty times a day he
asked himself what she had meant by claiming as her own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
a jewel which had been picked up from the floor of a
strange house at a time so dreadful, and which, in despite
of her explanations to him, he found it impossible to
believe was hers or ever could have been hers? He was
even tempted to ask her; but he never did. The words
would not come. Though they faltered again and again
upon his lips, he could not give utterance to them; no,
though with every passing day he felt that the bond uniting
her to him was growing weaker and weaker, and that
if something did not soon intervene to establish confidence
between them, he would presently lose all hope
of the treasure for the possession of which he was now
ready to barter away half the remaining years of his life.</p>

<p>Her increasing reticence, and the almost stony look of
misery that now confronted him without let or hindrance
from her wide gray eyes, were not calculated to reassure
him or make his future prospects look any brighter. Her
pain, if pain it were, or remorse, if remorse it could be,
was not of a kind to feel the influence of time; and,
struck with dismay, alarmed in spite of himself, if not for
her reason at least for his own, he watched her from day
to day, feeling that now he would give his life not merely
to possess her, but to understand her and the secret that
was gnawing at her heart.</p>

<p>At last there came a day when he could no longer
restrain himself. She had been seated in his presence,
and had been handed a letter which for the moment
seemed to thoroughly overwhelm her. We know what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
that letter was. It was the note which had been sent as
a decoy by the detective Hickory, but which she had no
reason to doubt was a real communication from Craik
Mansell, despite the strange handwriting on the envelope.
It prayed her for an interview. It set the time and mentioned
the place of meeting, and created for the instant
such a turmoil in her usually steady brain that she could
not hide it from the searching eyes that watched her.</p>

<p>"What is it, Imogene?" inquired Mr. Orcutt, drawing
near her with a gesture of such uncontrollable anxiety, it
looked as if he were about to snatch the letter from her
hand.</p>

<p>For reply she rose, walked to the grate, in which a low
wood fire was burning, and plunged the paper in among
the coals. When it was all consumed she turned and
faced Mr. Orcutt.</p>

<p>"You must excuse me," she murmured; "but the
letter was one which I absolutely desired no one to see."</p>

<p>But he did not seem to hear her apology. He stood
with his gaze fixed on the fire, and his hand clenched
against his heart, as if something in the fate of that
wretched sheet of paper reminded him of the love and
hope that were shrivelling up before his eyes.</p>

<p>She saw his look and drooped her head with a sudden
low moan of mingled shame and suffering.</p>

<p>"Am I killing <i>you?</i>" she faintly cried. "Are my
strange, wild ways driving <i>you</i> to despair? I had not
thought of that. I am so selfish, I had not thought of
that!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>This evidence of feeling, the first she had ever shown
him, moved Mr. Orcutt deeply. Advancing toward her,
with sudden passion, he took her by the hand.</p>

<p>"Killing me?" he repeated. "Yes, you are killing
me. Don't you see how fast I am growing old? Don't
you see how the dust lies thick upon the books that used
to be my solace and delight? I do not understand you,
Imogene. I love you and I do not understand your
grief, or what it is that is affecting you in this terrible
way. Tell me. Let me know the nature of the forces
with which I have to contend, and I can bear all the
rest."</p>

<p>This appeal, forced as it was from lips unused to
prayer, seemed to strike her, absorbed though she was in
her own suffering. Looking at him with real concern, she
tried to speak, but the words faltered on her tongue.
They came at last, however, and he heard her say:</p>

<p>"I wish I could weep, if only to show you I am not
utterly devoid of womanly sympathy for an anguish I
cannot cure. But the fountain of my tears is dried at its
source. I do not think I can ever weep again. I am
condemned to tread a path of misery and despair, and
must traverse it to the end without weakness and without
help. Do not ask me why, for I can never tell you. And
do not detain me now, or try to make me talk, for I must
go where I can be alone and silent."</p>

<p>She was slipping away, but he caught her by the wrist
and drew her back. His pain and perplexity had
reached their climax.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>"You must speak," he cried. "I have paltered long
enough with this matter. You must tell me what it is that
is destroying your happiness and mine."</p>

<p>But her eyes, turning toward him, seemed to echo that
<i>must</i> in a look of disdain eloquent enough to scorn all
help from words, and in the indomitable determination of
her whole aspect he saw that he might slay her, but that
he could never make her speak.</p>

<p>Loosing her with a gesture of despair, he turned away.
When he glanced back again she was gone.</p>

<p>The result of this interview was naturally an increased
doubt and anxiety on his part. He could not attend to
his duties with any degree of precision, he was so haunted
by uneasy surmises as to what might have been the contents
of the letter which he had thus seen her destroy before
his eyes. As for her words, they were like her conduct,
an insolvable mystery, for which he had no key.</p>

<p>His failure to find her at home when he returned that
night added to his alarm, especially as he remembered
the vivid thunderstorm that had deluged the town in the
afternoon. Nor, though she came in very soon and
offered both excuses and explanations for her absence,
did he experience any appreciable relief, or feel at all
satisfied that he was not threatened with some secret and
terrible catastrophe. Indeed, the air of vivid and feverish
excitement which pervaded every look of hers from
this time, making each morning and evening distinctive
in his memory as a season of fresh fear and renewed suspense,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
was enough of itself to arouse this sense of an unknown,
but surely approaching, danger. He saw she was
on the look out for some event, he knew not what, and
studied the papers as sedulously as she, in the hope of
coming upon some revelation that should lay bare the
secret of this new condition of hers. At last he thought
he had found it. Coming home one day from the court,
he called her into his presence, and, without pause or
preamble, exclaimed, with almost cruel abruptness:</p>

<p>"An event of possible interest to you has just taken
place. The murderer of Mrs. Clemmens has just cut his
throat."</p>

<p>He saw before he had finished the first clause that he
had struck at the very citadel of her terrors and her woe.
At the end of the second sentence he knew, beyond all
doubt now, what it was she had been fearing, if not expecting.
Yet she said not a word, and by no movement
betrayed that the steel had gone through and through her
heart.</p>

<p>A demon&mdash;the maddening demon of jealousy&mdash;gripped
him for the first time with relentless force.</p>

<p>"Ah, you have been looking for it?" he cried in a
choked voice. "You know this man, then&mdash;knew him,
perhaps, before the murder of Mrs. Clemmens; knew
him, and&mdash;and, perhaps, loved him?"</p>

<p>She did not reply.</p>

<p>He struck his forehead with his hand, as if the moment
was perfectly intolerable to him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>"Answer," he cried. "Did you know Gouverneur
Hildreth or not?"</p>

<p>"<i>Gouverneur Hildreth?</i>" Oh, the sharp surprise, the
wailing anguish of her tone! Mr. Orcutt stood amazed.
"It is not he who has made this attempt upon his life!&mdash;not
he!" she shrieked like one appalled.</p>

<p>Perhaps because all other expression or emotion failed
him, Mr. Orcutt broke forth into a loud and harrowing
laugh. "And who else should it be?" he cried.
"What other man stands accused of having murdered
Widow Clemmens? You are mad, Imogene; you don't
know what you say or what you do."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am mad," she repeated&mdash;"mad!" and leaned
her forehead forward on the back of a high chair beside
which she had been standing, and hid her face and struggled
with herself for a moment, while the clock went on
ticking, and the wretched surveyer of her sorrow stood
looking at her bended head like a man who does not
know whether it is he or she who is in the most danger of
losing his reason.</p>

<p>At last a word struggled forth from between her
clasped hands.</p>

<p>"When did it happen?" she gasped, without lifting
her head. "Tell me all about it. I think I can understand."</p>

<p>The noted lawyer smiled a bitter smile, and spoke for
the first time, without pity and without mercy.</p>

<p>"He has been trying for some days to effect his death.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
His arrest and the little prospect there is of his escaping
trial seem to have maddened his gentlemanly brain.
Fire-arms were not procurable, neither was poison nor a
rope, but a pewter plate is enough in the hands of a
desperate man. He broke one in two last night, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused, sick and horror-stricken. Her face had
risen upon him from the back of the chair, and was staring
upon him like that of a Medusa. Before that gaze
the flesh crept on his bones and the breath of life refused
to pass his lips. Gazing at her with rising horror, he saw
her stony lips slowly part.</p>

<p>"Don't go on," she whispered. "I can see it all without
the help of words." Then, in a tone that seemed to
come from some far-off world of nightmare, she painfully
gasped, "Is he dead?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 355px;">
<img src="images/ill03.jpg" width="355" height="600" alt="&quot;He paused, sick and horror-stricken. Her face had risen upon him from the back of the chair, and was staring at him like that of a Medusa.&quot;&mdash;(Page 252.)" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;He paused, sick and horror-stricken. Her face had risen upon him from the back of the chair, and was staring at him like that of a Medusa.&quot;&mdash;(Page 252.)</span>
</div>

<p>Mr. Orcutt was a man who, up to the last year, had
never known what it was to experience a real and controlling
emotion. Life with him had meant success in
public affairs, and a certain social pre-eminence that
made his presence in any place the signal of admiring
looks and respectful attentions. But let no man think
that, because his doom delays, it will never come. Passions
such as he had deprecated in others, and desires
such as he had believed impossible to himself, had seized
upon him with ungovernable power, and in this moment
especially he felt himself yielding to their sway with no
more power of resistance than a puppet experiences in the
grasp of a whirlwind. Meeting that terrible eye of hers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
burning with an anxiety for a man he despised, and
hearing that agonized question from lips whose touch he
had never known, he experienced a sudden wild and
almost demoniac temptation to hurl back the implacable
"Yes" that he felt certain would strike her like a dead
woman to the ground. But the horrid impulse passed,
and, with a quick remembrance of the claims of honor
upon one bearing his name and owning his history, he
controlled himself with a giant resolution, and merely
dropping his eyes from an anguish he dared no longer
confront, answered, quietly:</p>

<p>"No; he has hurt himself severely and has disfigured
his good looks for life, but he will not die; or so the
physicians think."</p>

<p>A long, deep, shuddering sigh swept through the room.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" came from her lips, and then all was
quiet again.</p>

<p>He looked up in haste; he could not bear the silence.</p>

<p>"Imogene&mdash;&mdash;" he began, but instantly paused in surprise
at the change which had taken place in her expression.
"What do you intend to do?" was his quick
demand. "You look as I have never seen you look
before."</p>

<p>"Do not ask me!" she returned. "I have no words
for what I am going to do. What <i>you</i> must do is to see
that Gouverneur Hildreth is released from prison. He
is not guilty, mind you; he never committed this crime
of which he is suspected, and in the shame of which suspicion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
he has this day attempted his life. If he is kept
in the restraint which is so humiliating to him, and if he
dies there, it will be murder&mdash;do you hear? murder!
And he <i>will</i> die there if he is not released; I know his
feelings only too well."</p>

<p>"But, Imogene&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush! don't argue. 'Tis a matter of life and death,
I tell you. He must be released! I know," she went on,
hurriedly, "what it is you want to say. You think you
cannot do this; that the evidence is all against him; that
he went to prison of his own free will and cannot hope
for release till his guilt or innocence has been properly
inquired into. But I know you can effect his enlargement
if you will. You are a lawyer, and understand all
the crooks and turns by which a man can sometimes be
made to evade the grasp of justice. Use your knowledge.
Avail yourself of your influence with the authorities, and
I&mdash;&mdash;" she paused and gave him a long, long look.</p>

<p>He was at her side in an instant.</p>

<p>"You would&mdash;what?" he cried, taking her hand in his
and pressing it impulsively.</p>

<p>"I would grant you whatever you ask," she murmured,
in a weariful tone.</p>

<p>"Would you be my wife?" he passionately inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the choked reply; "if I did not die first."</p>

<p>He caught her to his breast in rapture. He knelt at
her side and threw his arms about her waist.</p>

<p>"You shall not die," he cried. "You shall live and be
happy. Only marry me to-day."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not till Gouverneur Hildreth be released," she interposed,
gently.</p>

<p>He started as if touched by a galvanic battery, and
slowly rose up and coldly looked at her.</p>

<p>"Do you love him so madly you would sell yourself for
his sake?" he sternly demanded.</p>

<p>With a quick gesture she threw back her head as though
the indignant "No" that sprang to her lips would flash
out whether she would or not. But she restrained herself
in time.</p>

<p>"I cannot answer," she returned.</p>

<p>But he was master now&mdash;master of this dominating
spirit that had held him in check for so long a time, and
he was not to be put off.</p>

<p>"You must answer," he sternly commanded. "I have
the right to know the extent of your feeling for this man,
and I will. Do you <i>love</i> him, Imogene Dare? Tell me,
or I here swear that I will do nothing for him, either now
or at a time when he may need my assistance more than
you know."</p>

<p>This threat, uttered as he uttered it, could have but one
effect. Turning aside, so that he should not see the
shuddering revolt in her eyes, she mechanically whispered:</p>

<p>"And what if I did? Would it be so very strange?
Youth admires youth, Mr. Orcutt, and Mr. Hildreth is
very handsome and very unfortunate. Do not oblige me
to say more."</p>

<p>Mr. Orcutt, across whose face a dozen different emotions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
had flitted during the utterance of these few words,
drew back till half the distance of the room lay between
them.</p>

<p>"Nor do I wish to hear any more," he rejoined, slowly.
"You have said enough, quite enough. I understand
now all the past&mdash;all your terrors and all your secret
doubts and unaccountable behavior. The man you loved
was in danger, and you did not know how to manage his
release. Well, well, I am sorry for you, Imogene. I
wish I could help you. I love you passionately, and
would make you my wife in face of your affection for this
man if I could do for you what you request. But it is
impossible. Never during the whole course of my career
has a blot rested upon my integrity as a lawyer. I am
known as an honest man, and honest will I remain known to
the last. Besides, I could do nothing to effect his enlargement
if I tried. Nothing but the plainest proof that he
is innocent, or that another man is guilty, would avail
now to release him from the suspicion which his own admissions
have aroused."</p>

<p>"Then there is no hope?" was her slow and despairing
reply.</p>

<p>"None at present, Imogene," was his stern, almost as
despairing, answer.</p>

<p>As Mr. Orcutt sat over his lonely hearth that evening,
a servant brought to him the following letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;It is not fit that I should remain any longer
under your roof. I have a duty before me which separates me forever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
from the friendship and protection of honorable men and women.
No home but such as I can provide for myself by the work of my
own hands shall henceforth shelter the disgraced head of Imogene
Dare. Her fate, whatever it may prove to be, she bears alone, and
you, who have been so kind, shall never suffer from any association
with one whose name must henceforth become the sport of the crowd,
if not the execration of the virtuous. If your generous heart rebels
at this, choke it relentlessly down. I shall be already gone when you
read these lines, and nothing you could do or say would make me
come back. Good-by, and may Heaven grant you forgetfulness of
one whose only return to your benefactions has been to make you
suffer almost as much as she suffers herself.</p></div>

<p>As Mr. Orcutt read these last lines, District Attorney
Ferris was unsealing the anonymous missive which has
already been laid before my readers.</p>

<h3>HEART'S MARTYRDOM.</h3>

<div class='poem'>
Oh that a man might know<br />
The end of this day's business, ere it come;<br />
But it sufficeth that the day will end,<br />
And then the end is known!&mdash;<span class="smcap">Julius C&aelig;sar.</span><br />
<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>MR. FERRIS' first impulse upon dismissing the
detectives had been to carry the note he had
received to Mr. Orcutt. But a night's careful consideration
of the subject convinced him that the wisest course
would be to follow the suggestions conveyed in the letter,
and seek a direct interview with Imogene Dare.</div>

<p>It was not an agreeable task for him to undertake.
Miss Dare was a young lady whom he had always held in
the highest esteem. He had hoped to see her the wife
of his friend, and would have given much from his own
private stock of hope and happiness to have kept her
name free from the contumely which any association with
this dreadful crime must necessarily bring upon it. But
his position as prosecuting attorney of the county would
not allow him to consult his feelings any further in a
case of such serious import. The condition of Mr. Hildreth
was, to say the least, such as demanded the most
impartial action on the part of the public officials, and if
through any explanation of Miss Dare the one missing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
link in the chain of evidence against another could be
supplied, it was certainly his duty to do all he could to
insure it.</p>

<p>Accordingly at a favorable hour the next day, he made
his appearance at Mr. Orcutt's house, and learning that
Miss Dare had gone to Professor Darling's house for a
few days, followed her to her new home and requested
an interview.</p>

<p>She at once responded to his call. Little did he think
as she came into the parlor where he sat, and with even
more than her usual calm self-possession glided down
the length of that elegant apartment to his side, that she
had just come from a small room on the top floor, where,
in the position of a hired seamstress, she had been engaged
in cutting out the wedding garments of one of the
daughters of the house.</p>

<p>Her greeting was that of a person attempting to feign
a surprise she did not feel.</p>

<p>"Ah," said she, "Mr. Ferris! This is an unexpected
pleasure."</p>

<p>But Mr. Ferris had no heart for courtesies.</p>

<p>"Miss Dare," he began, without any of the preliminaries
which might be expected of him, "I have come
upon a disagreeable errand. I have a favor to ask. You
are in the possession of a piece of information which it is
highly necessary for me to share."</p>

<p>"I?"</p>

<p>The surprise betrayed in this single word was no more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
than was to be expected from a lady thus addressed,
neither did the face she turned so steadily toward him
alter under his searching gaze.</p>

<p>"If I can tell you any thing that you wish to know,"
she quietly declared, "I am certainly ready to do so, sir."</p>

<p>Deceived by the steadiness of her tone and the straightforward
look of her eyes, he proceeded, with a sudden
releasement from his embarrassment, to say:</p>

<p>"I shall have to recall to your mind a most painful
incident. You remember, on the morning when we met
at Mrs. Clemmens' house, claiming as your own a diamond
ring which was picked up from the floor at your feet?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Miss Dare, was this ring really yours, or were you
misled by its appearance into merely thinking it your
property? My excuse for asking this is that the ring, if
not yours, is likely to become an important factor in the
case to which the murder of this unfortunate woman has
led."</p>

<p>"Sir&mdash;&mdash;" The pause which followed the utterance
of this one word was but momentary, but in it what faint
and final hope may have gone down into the depths of
everlasting darkness God only knows. "Sir, since you
ask me the question, I will say that in one sense of the
term it was mine, and in another it was not. The ring
was mine, because it had been offered to me as a gift the
day before. The ring was not mine, because I had
refused to take it when it was offered."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>At these words, spoken with such quietness they
seemed like the mechanical utterances of a woman in a
trance, Mr. Ferris started to his feet. He could no
longer doubt that evidence of an important nature lay
before him.</p>

<p>"And may I ask," he inquired, without any idea of the
martyrdom he caused, "what was the name of the person
who offered you this ring, and from whom you refused to
take it?"</p>

<p>"The name?" She quavered for a moment, and her
eyes flashed up toward heaven with a look of wild appeal,
as if the requirement of this moment was more than even
she had strength to meet. Then a certain terrible calm
settled upon her, blotting the last hint of feeling from her
face, and, rising up in her turn, she met Mr. Ferris' inquiring
eye, and slowly and distinctly replied:</p>

<p>"It was Craik Mansell, sir. He is a nephew of Mrs.
Clemmens."</p>

<p>It was the name Mr. Ferris had come there to hear, yet
it gave him a slight shock when it fell from her lips&mdash;perhaps
because his mind was still running upon her supposed
relations with Mr. Orcutt. But he did not show
his feelings, however, and calmly asked:</p>

<p>"And was Mr. Mansell in this town the day before the
assault upon his aunt?"</p>

<p>"He was."</p>

<p>"And you had a conversation with him?"</p>

<p>"I had."</p>

<p>"May I ask where?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>For the first time she flushed; womanly shame had
not yet vanished entirely from her stricken breast; but
she responded as steadily as before:</p>

<p>"In the woods, sir, back of Mrs. Clemmens' house.
There were reasons"&mdash;she paused&mdash;"there were good
reasons, which I do not feel obliged to state, why a meeting
in such a place was not discreditable to us."</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris, who had received from other sources a full
version of the interview to which she thus alluded, experienced
a sudden revulsion of feeling against one he
could not but consider as a detected coquette; and, drawing
quickly back, made a gesture such as was not often
witnessed in those elegant apartments.</p>

<p>"You mean," said he, with a sharp edge to his tone
that passed over her dreary soul unheeded, "that you
were lovers?"</p>

<p>"I mean," said she, like the automaton she surely was
at that moment, "that he had paid me honorable addresses,
and that I had no reason to doubt his motives or
my own in seeking such a meeting."</p>

<p>"Miss Dare,"&mdash;all the District Attorney spoke in the
manner of Mr. Ferris now,&mdash;"if you refused Mr. Mansell
his ring, you must have returned it to him?"</p>

<p>She looked at him with an anguish that bespoke her
full appreciation of all this question implied, but unequivocally
bowed her head.</p>

<p>"It was in his possession, then," he continued, "when
you left him on that day and returned to your home?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," her lips seemed to say, though no distinct utterance
came from them.</p>

<p>"And you did not see it again till you found it on
the floor of Mrs. Clemmens' dining-room the morning of
the murder?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Miss Dare," said he, with greater mildness, after a
short pause, "you have answered my somewhat painful
inquiries with a straightforwardness I cannot sufficiently
commend. If you will now add to my gratitude by telling
me whether you have informed any one else of the
important facts you have just given me, I will distress you
by no further questions."</p>

<p>"Sir," said she, and her attitude showed that she
could endure but little more, "I have taken no one else
into my confidence. Such knowledge as I had to impart
was not matter for idle gossip."</p>

<p>And Mr. Ferris, being thus assured that his own surmises
and that of Hickory were correct, bowed with the
respect her pale face and rigid attitude seemed to demand,
and considerately left the house.</p>

<h3>CRAIK MANSELL.</h3>

<div class='center'>
Bring me unto my trial when you will.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Henry VI.</span><br />
<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>"HE is here."</div>

<p>Mr. Ferris threw aside his cigar, and looked
up at Mr. Byrd, who was standing before him.</p>

<p>"You had no difficulty, then?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. He acted like a man in hourly expectation
of some such summons. At the very first intimation of
your desire to see him in Sibley, he rose from his desk,
with what I thought was a meaning look at Mr. Goodman,
and after a few preparations for departure, signified
he was ready to take the next train."</p>

<p>"And did he ask no questions?"</p>

<p>"Only one. He wished to know if I were a detective.
And when I responded 'Yes,' observed with an inquiring
look: 'I am wanted as a witness, I suppose.' A suggestion
to which I was careful to make no reply."</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris pushed aside his writing and glanced toward
the door. "Show him in, Mr. Byrd," said he.</p>

<p>A moment after Mr. Mansell entered the room.</p>

<p>The District Attorney had never seen this man, and was
struck at once by the force and manliness of his appearance.
Half-rising from his seat to greet the visitor, he
said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have to beg your pardon, Mr. Mansell. Feeling it
quite necessary to see you, I took the liberty of requesting
you to take this journey, my own time being fully
occupied at present."</p>

<p>Mr. Mansell bowed&mdash;a slow, self-possessed bow,&mdash;and
advancing to the table before which the District Attorney
sat, laid his hand firmly upon it and said:</p>

<p>"No apologies are needed." Then shortly, "What is
it you want of me?"</p>

<p>The words were almost the same as those which
had been used by Mr. Hildreth under similar circumstances,
but how different was their effect! The one was
the utterance of a weak man driven to bay, the other of
a strong one. Mr. Ferris, who was by no means of an
impressible organization, flashed a look of somewhat uneasy
doubt at Mr. Byrd, and hesitated slightly before
proceeding.</p>

<p>"We have sent for you in this friendly way," he remarked,
at last, "in order to give you that opportunity
for explaining certain matters connected with your aunt's
sudden death which your well-known character and good
position seem to warrant. We think you can do this. At
all events I have accorded myself the privilege of so supposing;
and any words you may have to say will meet
with all due consideration. As Mrs. Clemmens' nephew,
you, of course, desire to see her murderer brought to
justice."</p>

<p>The slightly rising inflection given to the last few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
words made them to all intents and purposes a question,
and Mr. Byrd, who stood near by, waited anxiously for
the decided Yes which seemed the only possible reply under
the circumstances, but it did not come.</p>

<p>Surprised, and possibly anxious, the District Attorney
repeated himself.</p>

<p>"As her nephew," said he, "and the inheritor of
the few savings she has left behind her, you can have but
one wish on this subject, Mr. Mansell?"</p>

<p>But this attempt succeeded no better than the first.
Beyond a slight compression of the lips, Mr. Mansell
gave no manifestation of having heard this remark, and
both Mr. Ferris and the detective found themselves forced
to wonder at the rigid honesty of a man who, whatever
death-giving blow he may have dealt, would not allow
himself to escape the prejudice of his accusers by assenting
to a supposition he and they knew to be false.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris did not press the question.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mansell," he remarked instead, "a person by the
name of Gouverneur Hildreth is, as you must know,
under arrest at this time, charged with the crime of having
given the blow that led to your aunt's death. The
evidence against him is strong, and the public generally
have no doubt that his arrest will lead to trial, if not to
conviction. But, unfortunately for us, however fortunately
for him, another person has lately been found,
against whom an equal show of evidence can be raised,
and it is for the purpose of satisfying ourselves that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
it is but a show, we have requested your presence here
to-day."</p>

<p>A spasm, vivid as it was instantaneous, distorted for a
moment the powerful features of Craik Mansell at the
words, "another person," but it was gone before the
sentence was completed; and when Mr. Ferris ceased, he
looked up with the steady calmness which made his bearing
so remarkable.</p>

<p>"I am waiting to hear the name of this freshly
suspected person," he observed.</p>

<p>"Cannot you imagine?" asked the District Attorney,
coldly, secretly disconcerted under a gaze that held his
own with such steady persistence.</p>

<p>The eyeballs of the other flashed like coals of fire.</p>

<p>"I think it is my right to hear it spoken," he returned.</p>

<p>This display of feeling restored Mr. Ferris to himself.</p>

<p>"In a moment, sir," said he. "Meanwhile, have you
any objections to answering a few questions I would like
to put to you?"</p>

<p>"I will hear them," was the steady reply.</p>

<p>"You know," said the District Attorney, "you are at
perfect liberty to answer or not, as you see fit. I have no
desire to entrap you into any acknowledgments you may
hereafter regret."</p>

<p>"Speak," was the sole response he received.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said Mr. Ferris, "are you willing to tell me
where you <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'where'">were</ins> when you first heard of the assault
which had been made upon your aunt?"</p>

<p>"I was in my place at the mill."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>"And&mdash;pardon me if I go too far&mdash;were you also there
the morning she was murdered?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Mr. Mansell, if you could tell us where you were at
that time, it would be of great benefit to us, and possibly
to yourself."</p>

<p>"To myself?"</p>

<p>Having shown his surprise, or, possibly, his alarm, by
the repetition of the other's words, Craik Mansell paused
and looked slowly around the room until he encountered
Mr. Byrd's eye. There was a steady compassion in the
look he met there that seemed to strike him with great
force, for he at once replied that he was away from home,
and stopped&mdash;his glance still fixed upon Mr. Byrd, as if,
by the very power of his gaze, he would force the secrets
of that detective's soul to the surface.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mansell," pursued the District Attorney, "a
distinct avowal on your part of the place where you were
at that time, would be best for us both, I am sure."</p>

<p>"Do you not already know?" inquired the other, his
eye still upon Horace Byrd.</p>

<p>"We have reason to think you were in this town,"
averred Mr. Ferris, with an emphasis calculated to recall
the attention of his visitor to himself.</p>

<p>"And may I ask," Craik Mansell quietly said, "what
reason you can have for such a supposition? No one could
have seen me here, for, till to-day I have not entered the
streets of this place since my visit to my aunt three months
ago."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was not necessary to enter the streets of this town
to effect a visit to Mrs. Clemmens' house, Mr. Mansell."</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>There was the faintest hint of emotion in the intonation
he gave to that one word, but it vanished before he
spoke his next sentence.</p>

<p>"And how," asked he, "can a person pass from Sibley
Station to the door of my aunt's house without going
through the streets?"</p>

<p>Instead of replying, Mr. Ferris inquired:</p>

<p>"Did you get out at Sibley Station, Mr. Mansell?"</p>

<p>But the other, with unmoved self-possession, returned:</p>

<p>"I have not said so."</p>

<p>"Mr. Mansell," the District Attorney now observed,
"we have no motive in deceiving or even in misleading
you. You were in this town on the morning of your
aunt's murder, and you were even in her house. Evidence
which you cannot dispute proves this, and the question
that now arises, and of whose importance we leave you to
judge, is whether you were there prior to the visit of Mr.
Hildreth, or after. Any proof you may have to show that
it was before will receive its due consideration."</p>

<p>A change, decided as it was involuntary, took place in
the hitherto undisturbed countenance of Craik Mansell.
Leaning forward, he surveyed Mr. Ferris with great earnestness.</p>

<p>"I asked that man," said he, pointing with a steady
forefinger at the somewhat abashed detective, "if I were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
not wanted here simply as a witness, and he did not say
No. Now, sir," he continued, turning back with a slight
gesture of disdain to the District Attorney, "was the man
right in allowing me to believe such a fact, or was he not?
I would like an answer to my question before I proceed
further, if you please."</p>

<p>"You shall have it, Mr. Mansell. If this man did not
answer you, it was probably because he did not feel justified
in so doing. He knew I had summoned you
here in the hope of receiving such explanations of your
late conduct as should satisfy me you had nothing to do
with your aunt's murder. The claims upon my consideration,
which are held by certain persons allied to you in
this matter"&mdash;Mr. Ferris' look was eloquent of his real
meaning here&mdash;"are my sole justification for this somewhat
unusual method of dealing with a suspected
man."</p>

<p>A smile, bitter, oh, how bitter in its irony! traversed
the firm-set lips of Craik Mansell for a moment, then he
bowed with a show of deference to the District Attorney,
and settling into the attitude of a man willing to plead his
own cause, responded:</p>

<p>"It would be more just, perhaps, if I first heard the
reasons you have for suspecting me, before I attempt
to advance arguments to prove the injustice of your suspicions."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Ferris, "you shall have them. If
frankness on my part can do aught to avert the terrible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
scandal which your arrest and its consequent developments
would cause, I am willing to sacrifice thus much to
my friendship for Mr. Orcutt. But if I do this, I shall
expect an equal frankness in return. The matter is too
serious for subterfuge."</p>

<p>The other merely waved his hand.</p>

<p>"The reasons," proceeded Mr. Ferris, "for considering
you a party as much open to suspicion as Mr. Hildreth,
are several. First, we have evidence to prove
your great desire for a sum of money equal to your aunt's
savings, in order to introduce an invention which you
have just patented.</p>

<p>"Secondly, we can show that you left your home in
Buffalo the day before the assault, came to Monteith, the
next town to this, alighted at the remote station assigned
to the use of the quarrymen, crossed the hills and
threaded the woods till you came to a small hut back of
your aunt's house, where you put up for the night.</p>

<p>"Thirdly, evidence is not lacking to prove that while
there you visited your aunt's once, if not twice; the last
time on the very morning she was killed, entering the
house in a surreptitious way by the back door, and leaving
it in the same suspicious manner.</p>

<p>"And fourthly, we can prove that you escaped from
this place as you had come, secretly, and through a difficult
and roundabout path over the hills.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mansell, these facts, taken with your reticence
concerning a visit so manifestly of importance to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
authorities to know, must strike even you as offering
grounds for a suspicion as grave as that attaching to Mr.
Hildreth."</p>

<p>With a restraint marked as it was impressive, Mr.
Mansell looked at the District Attorney for a moment,
and then said:</p>

<p>"You speak of proof. Now, what proof have you to
give that I put up, as you call it, for a night, or even for
an hour, in the hut which stands in the woods back of
my aunt's house?"</p>

<p>"This," was Mr. Ferris' reply. "It is known you were
in the woods the afternoon previous to the assault upon
your aunt, because you were seen there in company with
a young lady with whom you were holding a tryst. Did
you speak, sir?"</p>

<p>"No!" was the violent, almost disdainful, rejoinder.</p>

<p>"You did not sleep at your aunt's, for her rooms contained
not an evidence of having been opened for a
guest, while the hut revealed more than one trace of having
been used as a dormitory. I could even tell you
where you cut the twigs of hemlock that served you for
a pillow, and point to the place where you sat when you
scribbled over the margin of the Buffalo <i>Courier</i> with a
blue pencil, such as that I now see projecting from your
vest pocket."</p>

<p>"It is not necessary," replied the young man, heavily
frowning. Then with another short glance at Mr. Ferris,
he again demanded:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is your reason for stating I visited my aunt's
house on the morning she was murdered? Did any one
see me do it? or does the house, like the hut, exhibit
traces of my presence there at that particular time?"</p>

<p>There was irony in his tone, and a disdain almost
amounting to scorn in his wide-flashing blue eyes; but
Mr. Ferris, glancing at the hand clutched about the railing
of the desk, remarked quietly:</p>

<p>"You do not wear the diamond ring you carried away
with you from the tryst I mentioned? Can it be that the
one which was picked up after the assault, on the floor of
Mrs. Clemmens' dining-room, could have fallen from your
finger, Mr. Mansell?"</p>

<p>A start, the first this powerfully repressed man had
given, showed that his armor of resistance had been
pierced at last.</p>

<p>"How do you know," he quickly asked, "that I carried
away a diamond ring from the tryst you speak of?"</p>

<p>"Circumstances," returned the District Attorney,
"prove it beyond a doubt. Miss Dare&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss Dare!"</p>

<p>Oh, the indescribable tone of this exclamation! Mr.
Byrd shuddered as he heard it, and looked at Mr. Mansell
with a new feeling, for which he had no name.</p>

<p>"Miss Dare," repeated the District Attorney, without,
apparently, regarding the interruption, "acknowledges
she returned you the ring which you endeavored at that
interview to bestow upon her."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah!" The word came after a moment's pause. "I
see the case has been well worked up, and it only remains
for me to give you such explanations as I choose to make.
Sir," declared he, stepping forward, and bringing his
clenched hand down upon the desk at which Mr. Ferris
was sitting, "I did not kill my aunt. I admit that I paid
her a visit. I admit that I stayed in the woods back of her
house, and even slept in the hut, as you have said; but
that was on the day previous to her murder, and not after
it. I went to see her for the purpose of again urging the
claims of my invention upon her. I went secretly, and
by the roundabout way you describe, because I had
another purpose in visiting Sibley, which made it expedient
for me to conceal my presence in the town. I failed
in my efforts to enlist the sympathies of my aunt in regard
to my plans, and I failed also in compassing that
other desire of my heart of which the ring you mention
was a token. Both failures unnerved me, and I lay in
that hut all night. I even lay there most of the next
morning; but I did not see my aunt again, and I did not
lift my hand against her life."</p>

<p>There was indescribable quiet in the tone, but there
was indescribable power also, and the look he levelled
upon the District Attorney was unwaveringly solemn and
hard.</p>

<p>"You deny, then, that you entered the widow's house
on the morning of the murder?"</p>

<p>"I do."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is, then, a question of veracity between you and
Miss Dare?"</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>"She asserts she gave you back the ring you offered
her. If this is so, and that ring was in your possession
after you left her on Monday evening, how came it to be
in the widow's dining-room the next morning, if you did
not carry it there?"</p>

<p>"I can only repeat my words," rejoined Mr. Mansell.</p>

<p>The District Attorney replied impatiently. For various
reasons he did not wish to believe this man guilty.</p>

<p>"You do not seem very anxious to assist me in my
endeavors to reach the truth," he observed. "Cannot
you tell me what you did with the ring after you left
Miss Dare? Whether you put it on your finger, or
thrust it into your pocket, or tossed it into the marsh?
If you did not carry it to the house, some one else must
have done so, and you ought to be able to help us in
determining who."</p>

<p>But Mr. Mansell shortly responded:</p>

<p>"I have nothing to say about the ring. From the
moment Miss Dare returned it to me, as you say, it was,
so far as I am concerned, a thing forgotten. I do not
know as I should ever have thought of it again, if you
had not mentioned it to me to-day. How it vanished
from my possession only to reappear upon the scene of
murder, some more clever conjurer than myself must
explain."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>"And this is all you have to say, Mr. Mansell?"</p>

<p>"This is all I have to say."</p>

<p>"Byrd," suggested the District Attorney, after a long
pause, during which the subject of his suspicions had
stood before him as rigid and inscrutable as a statue in
bronze, "Mr. Mansell would probably like to go to the
hotel, unless, indeed, he desires to return immediately to
Buffalo."</p>

<p>Craik Mansell at once started forward.</p>

<p>"Do you intend to allow me to return to Buffalo?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the District Attorney's reply.</p>

<p>"You are a good man," broke involuntarily from the
other's lips, and he impulsively reached out his hand,
but as quickly drew it back with a flush of pride that
greatly became him.</p>

<p>"I do not say," quoth Mr. Ferris, "that I exempt you
from surveillance. As prosecuting attorney of this district,
my duty is to seek out and discover the man who
murdered Mrs. Clemmens, and your explanations have
not been as full or as satisfactory as I could wish."</p>

<p>"Your men will always find me at my desk in the
mill," said Mr. Mansell, coldly. And, with another
short bow, he left the attorney's side and went quickly
out.</p>

<p>"That man is innocent," declared Mr. Ferris, as
Horace Byrd leaned above him in expectation of instructions
to keep watch over the departing visitor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>"The way in which he held out his hand to me spoke
volumes."</p>

<p>The detective cast a sad glance at Craik Mansell's
retreating figure.</p>

<p>"You could not convince Hickory of that fact,"
said he.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>
<h2>XXIII.</h2>

<h3>MR. ORCUTT.</h3>

<div class='center'>
What is it she does now?&mdash;<span class="smcap">Macbeth.</span><br />
<br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
My resolution's plac'd, and I have nothing<br />
Of woman in me. Now, from head to foot<br />
I am marble&mdash;constant.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Antony and Cleopatra.</span><br />
<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>THESE words rang in the ears of Mr. Ferris. For
he felt himself disturbed by them. Hickory
did not believe Mr. Mansell innocent.</div>

<p>At last he sent for that detective.</p>

<p>"Hickory," he asked, "why do you think Mansell,
rather than Hildreth, committed this crime?"</p>

<p>Now this query, on the part of the District Attorney,
put Hickory into a quandary. He wished to keep his
promise to Horace Byrd, and yet he greatly desired to
answer his employer's question truthfully. Without any
special sympathies of his own, he yet had an undeniable
leaning toward justice, and justice certainly demanded
the indictment of Mansell. He ended by compromising
matters.</p>

<p>"Mr. Ferris," said he, "when you went to see Miss
Dare the other day, what did you think of her state of
mind?"</p>

<p>"That it was a very unhappy one."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>"Didn't you think more than that, sir? Didn't you
think she believed Mr. Mansell guilty of this crime?"</p>

<p>"Yes," admitted the other, with reluctance.</p>

<p>"If Miss Dare is attached to Mr. Mansell, she must
feel certain of his guilt to <i>offer</i> testimony against him.
Her belief should go for something, sir; for much, it
strikes me, when you consider what a woman she is."</p>

<p>This conversation increased Mr. Ferris' uneasiness.
Much as he wished to spare the feelings of Miss Dare,
and, through her, those of his friend, Mr. Orcutt, the
conviction of Mansell's criminality was slowly gaining
ground in his mind. He remembered the peculiar manner
of the latter during the interview they had held
together; his quiet acceptance of the position of a suspected
man, and his marked reticence in regard to the
ring. Though the delicate nature of the interests involved
might be sufficient to explain his behavior in the
latter regard, his whole conduct could not be said to be
that of a disinterested man, even if it were not necessarily
that of a guilty one. In whatever way Mr. Ferris looked
at it, he could come to but one conclusion, and that was,
that justice to Hildreth called for such official attention
to the evidence which had been collected against Mansell
as should secure the indictment of that man against
whom could be brought the more convincing proof of
guilt.</p>

<p>Not that Mr. Ferris meant, or in anywise considered it
good policy, to have Mansell arrested at this time. As<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
the friend of Mr. Orcutt, it was manifestly advisable for
him to present whatever evidence he possessed against
Mansell directly to the Grand Jury. For in this way he
would not only save the lawyer from the pain and humiliation
of seeing the woman he so much loved called up as
a witness against the man who had successfully rivalled
him in her affections, but would run the chance, at least,
of eventually preserving from open knowledge, the various
details, if not the actual facts, which had led to this
person being suspected of crime. For the Grand Jury is
a body whose business it is to make secret inquisition into
criminal offences. Its members are bound by oath to
the privacy of their deliberations. If, therefore, they
should find the proofs presented to them by the District
Attorney insufficient to authorize an indictment against
Mansell, nothing of their proceedings would transpire.
While, on the contrary, if they decided that the evidence
was such as to oblige them to indict Mansell instead of
Hildreth, neither Mr. Orcutt nor Miss Dare could hold
the District Attorney accountable for the exposures that
must follow.</p>

<p>The course, therefore, of Mr. Ferris was determined
upon. All the evidence in his possession against both
parties, together with the verdict of the coroner's jury,
should go at once before the Grand Jury; Mansell, in the
meantime, being so watched that a bench-warrant issuing
upon the indictment would have him safely in custody at
any moment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>But this plan for saving Mr. Orcutt's feelings did not
succeed as fully as Mr. Ferris hoped. By some means or
other the rumor got abroad that another man than Hildreth
had fallen under the suspicion of the authorities,
and one day Mr. Ferris found himself stopped on the
street by the very person he had for a week been endeavoring
to avoid.</p>

<p>"Mr. Orcutt!" he cried, "how do you do? I did not
recognize you at first."</p>

<p>"No?" was the sharp rejoinder. "I'm not myself
nowadays. I have a bad cold." With which impatient
explanation he seized Mr. Ferris by the arm and said:
"But what is this I hear? You have your eye on another
party suspected of being Mrs. Clemmens' murderer?"</p>

<p>The District Attorney bowed uneasily. He had hoped
to escape the discussion of this subject with Mr. Orcutt.</p>

<p>The lawyer observed the embarrassment his question
had caused, and instantly turned pale, notwithstanding
the hardihood which a long career at the bar had given
him.</p>

<p>"Ferris," he pursued, in a voice he strove hard to
keep steady, "we have always been good friends, in spite
of the many tilts we have had together before the court.
Will you be kind enough to inform me if your suspicions
are founded upon evidence collected by yourself, or at
the instigation of parties professing to know more about
this murder than they have hitherto revealed?"</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris could not fail to understand the true nature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
of this question, and out of pure friendship answered
quietly:</p>

<p>"I have allowed myself to look with suspicion upon
this Mansell&mdash;for it is Mrs. Clemmens' nephew who is at
present occupying our attention,&mdash;because the facts which
have come to light in his regard are as criminating in
their nature as those which have transpired in reference
to Mr. Hildreth. The examination into this matter,
which my duty requires, has been any thing but pleasant
to me, Mr. Orcutt. The evidence of such witnesses as
will have to be summoned before the Grand Jury, is
of a character to bring open humiliation, if not secret
grief, upon persons for whom I entertain the highest
esteem."</p>

<p>The pointed way in which this was said convinced
Mr. Orcutt that his worst fears had been realized.
Turning partly away, but not losing his hold upon
the other's arm, he observed with what quietness he
could:</p>

<p>"You say that so strangely, I feel forced to put
another question to you. If what I have to ask strikes
you with any surprise, remember that my own astonishment
and perplexity at being constrained to interrogate
you in this way, are greater than any sensation you can
yourself experience. What I desire to know is this.
Among the witnesses you have collected against this
last suspected party, there are some women, are there
not?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>The District Attorney gravely bowed.</p>

<p>"Ferris, is Miss Dare amongst them?"</p>

<p>"Orcutt, she is."</p>

<p>With a look that expressed his secret mistrust the
lawyer gave way to a sudden burst of feeling.</p>

<p>"Ferris," he wrathfully acknowledged, "I may be a
fool, but I don't see what she can have to say on this
subject. It is impossible she should know any thing
about the murder; and, as for this Mansell&mdash;&mdash;" He
made a violent gesture with his hand, as if the very idea
of her having any acquaintance with the nephew of Mrs.
Clemmens were simply preposterous.</p>

<p>The District Attorney, who saw from this how utterly
ignorant the other was concerning Miss Dare's relations
to the person named, felt his embarrassment increase.</p>

<p>"Mr. Orcutt," he replied, "strange as it may appear
to you, Miss Dare <i>has</i> testimony to give of value to the
prosecution, or she would not be reckoned among its
witnesses. What that testimony is, I must leave to her
discretion to make known to you, as she doubtless will,
if you question her with sufficient consideration. I
never forestall matters myself, nor would you wish me to
tell you what would more becomingly come from her
own lips. But, Mr. Orcutt, this I can say: that if it had
been given me to choose between the two alternatives of
resigning my office and of pursuing an inquiry which
obliges me to submit to the unpleasantness of a judicial
investigation a person held in so much regard by yourself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
I would have given up my office with pleasure, so
keenly do I feel the embarrassment of my position and
the unhappiness of yours. But any mere resignation on
my part would have availed nothing to save Miss Dare
from appearing before the Grand Jury. The evidence
she has to give in this matter makes the case against
Mansell as strong as that against Hildreth, and it would
be the duty of any public prosecutor to recognize the
fact and act accordingly."</p>

<p>Mr. Orcutt, who had by the greatest effort succeeded
in calming himself through this harangue, flashed sarcastically
at this last remark, and surveyed Mr. Ferris with
a peculiar look.</p>

<p>"Are you sure," he inquired in a slow, ironical tone,
"that she has not succeeded in making it stronger?"</p>

<p>The look, the tone, were unexpected, and greatly
startled Mr. Ferris. Drawing nearer to his friend, he
returned his gaze with marked earnestness.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he asked, with secret anxiety.</p>

<p>But the wary lawyer had already repented this unwise
betrayal of his own doubts. Meeting his companion's
eye with a calmness that amazed himself, he remarked,
instead of answering:</p>

<p>"It was through Miss Dare, then, that your attention
was first drawn to Mrs. Clemmens' nephew?"</p>

<p>"No," disclaimed Mr. Ferris, hastily. "The detectives
already had their eyes upon him. But a hint from
her went far toward determining me upon pursuing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
matter," he allowed, seeing that his friend was determined
upon hearing the truth.</p>

<p>"So then," observed the other, with a stern dryness
that recalled his manner at the bar, "she opened a communication
with you herself?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>It was enough. Mr. Orcutt dropped the arm of Mr.
Ferris, and, with his usual hasty bow, turned shortly
away. The revelation which he believed himself to have
received in this otherwise far from satisfactory interview,
was one that he could not afford to share&mdash;that is, not
yet; not while any hope remained that circumstances
would so arrange themselves as to make it unnecessary
for him to do so. If Imogene Dare, out of her insane desire
to free Gouverneur Hildreth from the suspicion that
oppressed him, had resorted to perjury and invented evidence
tending to show the guilt of another party&mdash;and
remembering her admissions at their last interview and
the language she had used in her letter of farewell, no
other conclusion offered itself,&mdash;what alternative was left
him but to wait till he had seen her before he proceeded
to an interference that would separate her from himself
by a gulf still greater than that which already existed between
them? To be sure, the jealousy which consumed
him, the passionate rage that seized his whole being when
he thought of all she dared do for the man she loved,
or that he thought she loved, counselled him to nip this
attempt of hers in the bud, and by means of a word to Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
Ferris throw such a doubt upon her veracity as a witness
against this new party as should greatly influence the action
of the former in the critical business he had in hand.
But Mr. Orcutt, while a prey to unwonted passions, had
not yet lost control of his reason, and reason told him
that impulse was an unsafe guide for him to follow at this
time. Thought alone&mdash;deep and concentrated thought&mdash;would
help him out of this crisis with honor and safety.
But thought would not come at call. In all his quick
walk home but one mad sentence formulated itself in his
brain, and that was: "She loves him so, she is willing to
perjure herself for his sake!" Nor, though he entered
his door with his usual bustling air and went through all
the customary observances of the hour with an appearance
of no greater abstraction and gloom than had characterized
him ever since the departure of Miss Dare, no
other idea obtruded itself upon his mind than this: "She
loves him so, she is willing to perjure herself for his
sake!"</p>

<p>Even the sight of his books, his papers, and all that
various paraphernalia of work and study which gives
character to a lawyer's library, was insufficient to restore
his mind to its usual condition of calm thought and accurate
judgment. Not till the clock struck eight and he
found himself almost without his own volition at Professor
Darling's house, did he realize all the difficulties of
his position and the almost intolerable nature of the
undertaking which had been forced upon him by the
exigencies of the situation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Dare, who had refused to see him at first, came
into his presence with an expression that showed him with
what reluctance she had finally responded to his peremptory
message. But in the few heavy moments he had
been obliged to wait, he had schooled himself to expect
coldness if not absolute rebuff. He therefore took no
heed of the haughty air of inquiry which she turned upon
him, but came at once to the point, saying almost before
she had closed the door:</p>

<p>"What is this you have been doing, Imogene?"</p>

<p>A flush, such as glints across the face of a marble
statue, visited for a moment the still whiteness of her set
features, then she replied:</p>

<p>"Mr. Orcutt, when I left your house I told you I had
a wretched and unhappy duty to perform, that, when
once accomplished, would separate us forever. I have
done it, and the separation has come; why attempt to
bridge it?"</p>

<p>There was a sad weariness in her tone, a sad weariness
in her face, but he seemed to recognize neither. The
demon jealousy&mdash;that hindrance to all unselfish feeling&mdash;had
gripped him again, and the words that came to his
lips were at once bitter and masterful.</p>

<p>"Imogene," he cried, with as much wrath in his tone
as he had ever betrayed in her presence, "you do not
answer my question. I ask you what you have been
doing, and you reply, your duty. Now, what do you
mean by duty? Tell me at once and distinctly, for I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
will no longer be put off by any roundabout phrases concerning
a matter of such vital importance."</p>

<p>"Tell you?" This repetition of his words had a
world of secret anguish in it which he could not help but
notice. She did not succumb to it, however, but continued
in another moment: "You said to me, in the last
conversation we held together, that Gouverneur Hildreth
could not be released from his terrible position without a
distinct proof of innocence or the advancement of such
evidence against another as should turn suspicion aside
from him into a new and more justifiable quarter. I
could not, any more than he, give a distinct proof of his
innocence; but I could furnish the authorities with testimony
calculated to arouse suspicion in a fresh direction,
and I did it. For Gouverneur Hildreth had to be saved
at any price&mdash;<i>at any price</i>."</p>

<p>The <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'desparing'">despairing</ins> emphasis she laid upon the last phrase
went like hot steel to Mr. Orcutt's heart, and made his
eyes blaze with almost uncontrollable passion.</p>

<p>"<i>Je ne vois pas la necessit&eacute;</i>," said he, in that low, restrained
tone of bitter sarcasm which made his invective
so dreaded by opposing counsel. "If Gouverneur Hildreth
finds himself in an unfortunate position, he has
only his own follies and inordinate desire for this woman's
death to thank for it. Because you love him and compassionate
him beyond all measure, that is no reason why
you should perjure yourself, and throw the burden of his
shame upon a man as innocent as Mr. Mansell."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>But this tone, though it had made many a witness quail
before it, neither awed nor intimidated her.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you do not understand," came from her white
lips. "It is Mr. Hildreth who is perfectly innocent, and
not&mdash;&mdash;" But here she paused. "You will excuse me
from saying more," she said. "You, as a lawyer, ought
to know that I should not be compelled to speak on a
subject like this except under oath."</p>

<p>"Imogene!" A change had passed over Mr. Orcutt.
"Imogene, do you mean to affirm that you really have
charges to make against Craik Mansell; that this evidence
you propose to give is real, and not manufactured for the
purpose of leading suspicion aside from Hildreth?"</p>

<p>It was an insinuation against her veracity he never
could have made, or she have listened to, a few weeks before;
but the shield of her pride was broken between
them, and neither he nor she seemed to give any thought
to the reproach conveyed in these words.</p>

<p>"What I have to say is the truth," she murmured.
"I have not manufactured any thing."</p>

<p>With an astonishment he took no pains to conceal, Mr.
Orcutt anxiously surveyed her. He could not believe
this was so, yet how could he convict her of falsehood in
face of that suffering expression of resolve which she
wore. His methods as a lawyer came to his relief.</p>

<p>"Imogene," he slowly responded, "if, as you say, you
are in possession of positive evidence against this Mansell,
how comes it that you jeopardized the interests of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
man you loved by so long withholding your testimony?"</p>

<p>But instead of the flush of confusion which he expected,
she flashed upon him with a sudden revelation of
feeling that made him involuntarily start.</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you?" she replied. "You will have to
know some time, and why not now? I kept back the
truth," she replied, advancing a step, but without raising
her eyes to his, "because it is not the aspersed Hildreth
that I love, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Why did she pause? What was it she found so hard
to speak? Mr. Orcutt's expression became terrible.</p>

<p>"But the other," she murmured at last.</p>

<p>"The other!"</p>

<p>It was now her turn to start and look at him in surprise,
if not in some fear.</p>

<p>"What other?" he cried, seizing her by the hand.
"Name him. I will have no further misunderstanding
between us."</p>

<p>"Is it necessary?" she asked, with bitterness. "Will
Heaven spare me nothing?" Then, as she saw no relenting
in the fixed gaze that held her own, whispered, in
a hollow tone: "You have just spoken the name yourself&mdash;Craik
Mansell."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>Incredulity, anger, perplexity, all the emotions that
were seething in this man's troubled soul, spoke in that
simple exclamation. Then silence settled upon the room,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
during which she gained control over herself, and he the
semblance of it if no more. She was the first to speak.</p>

<p>"I know," said she, "that this avowal on my part
seems almost incredible to you; but it is no more so than
that which you so readily received from me the other day
in reference to Gouverneur Hildreth. A woman who
spends a month away from home makes acquaintances
which she does not always mention when she comes
back. I saw Mr. Mansell in Buffalo, and&mdash;&mdash;" turning,
she confronted the lawyer with her large gray eyes, in
which a fire burned such as he had never seen there
before&mdash;"and grew to esteem him," she went on. "For
the first time in my life I found myself in the presence of
a man whose nature commanded mine. His ambition,
his determination, his unconventional and forcible character
woke aspirations within me such as I had never
known myself capable of before. Life, which had
stretched out before me with a somewhat monotonous
outlook, changed to a panorama of varied and wonderful
experiences, as I listened to his voice and met the glance
of his eye; and soon, before he knew it, and certainly
before I realized it, words of love passed between us, and
the agony of that struggle began which has ended&mdash;&mdash; Ah,
let me not think how, or I shall go mad!"</p>

<p>Mr. Orcutt, who had watched her with a lover's fascination
during all this attempted explanation, shivered
for a moment at this last bitter cry of love and despair,
but spoke up when he did speak, with a coldness that
verged on severity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>"So you loved another man when you came back to
my home and listened to the words of passion which
came from <i>my</i> lips, and the hopes of future bliss and
happiness that welled up from <i>my</i> heart?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she whispered, "and, as you will remember, I
tried to suppress those hopes and turn a deaf ear to those
words, though I had but little prospect of marrying a
man whose fortunes depended upon the success of an invention
he could persuade no one to believe in."</p>

<p>"Yet you brought yourself to listen to those hopes on
the afternoon of the murder," he suggested, ironically.</p>

<p>"Can you blame me for that?" she cried, "remembering
how you pleaded, and what a revulsion of feeling I
was laboring under?"</p>

<p>A smile bitter as the fate which loomed before him,
and scornful as the feelings that secretly agitated his
breast, parted Mr. Orcutt's pale lips for an instant, and
he seemed about to give utterance to some passionate rejoinder,
but he subdued himself with a determined effort,
and quietly waiting till his voice was under full control,
remarked with lawyer-like brevity at last:</p>

<p>"You have not told me what evidence you have to
give against young Mansell?"</p>

<p>Her answer came with equal brevity if not equal
quietness.</p>

<p>"No; I have told Mr. Ferris; is not that enough?"</p>

<p>But he did not consider it so. "Ferris is a District
Attorney," said he, "and has demanded your confidence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
for the purposes of justice, while I am your friend. The
action you have taken is peculiar, and you may need
advice. But how can I give it or how can you receive it
unless there is a complete understanding between us?"</p>

<p>Struck in spite of herself, moved perhaps by a hope she
had not allowed herself to contemplate before, she looked
at him long and earnestly.</p>

<p>"And do you really wish to help me?" she inquired.
"Are you so generous as to forgive the pain, and possibly
the humiliation, I have inflicted upon you, and lend
me your assistance in case my testimony works its due
effect, and he be brought to trial instead of Mr. Hildreth?"</p>

<p>It was a searching and a pregnant question, for which
Mr. Orcutt was possibly not fully prepared, but his newly
gained control did not give way.</p>

<p>"I must insist upon hearing the facts before I say any
thing of my intentions," he averred. "Whatever they
may be, they cannot be more startling in their character
than those which have been urged against Hildreth."</p>

<p>"But they are," she whispered. Then with a quick
look around her, she put her mouth close to Mr. Orcutt's
ear and breathed:</p>

<p>"Mr. Hildreth is not the only man who, unseen by the
neighbors, visited Mrs. Clemmens' house on the morning
of the murder. Craik Mansell was there also."</p>

<p>"Craik Mansell! How do you know that? Ah," he
pursued, with the scornful intonation of a jealous man,
"I forgot that you are lovers."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>The sneer, natural as it was, perhaps, seemed to go to
her heart and wake its fiercest indignation.</p>

<p>"Hush," cried she, towering upon him with an ominous
flash of her proud eye. "Do not turn the knife in
<i>that</i> wound or you will seal my lips forever." And she
moved hastily away from his side. But in another instant
she determinedly returned, saying: "This is no
time for indulging in one's sensibilities. I affirm that
Craik Mansell visited his aunt on that day, because the
ring which was picked up on the floor of her dining-room&mdash;you
remember the ring, Mr. Orcutt?"</p>

<p>Remember it! Did he not? All his many perplexities
in its regard crowded upon him as he made a hurried bow
of acquiescence.</p>

<p>"It belonged to him," she continued. "He had
bought it for me, or, rather, had had the diamond reset
for me&mdash;it had been his mother's. Only the day before,
he had tried to put it on my finger in a meeting we had
in the woods back of his aunt's house. But I refused to
allow him. The prospect ahead was too dismal and unrelenting
for us to betroth ourselves, whatever our hopes
or wishes might be."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you had a meeting with this man in the woods
the day before his aunt was assaulted," echoed Mr. Orcutt,
turning upon her with an amazement that swallowed
up his wrath.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And he afterward visited her house?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And dropped that ring there?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Starting slowly, as if the thoughts roused by this short
statement of facts were such as demanded instant consideration,
Mr. Orcutt walked to the other side of the
room, where he paced up and down in silence for some
minutes. When he returned it was the lawyer instead of
the lover who stood before her.</p>

<p>"Then, it was the simple fact of finding this gentleman's
ring on the floor of Mrs. Clemmens' dining-room
that makes you consider him the murderer of his aunt?"
he asked, with a tinge of something like irony in his
tone.</p>

<p>"No," she breathed rather than answered. "That
was a proof, of course, that he had been there, but I
should never have thought of it as an evidence of guilt
if the woman herself had not uttered, in our hearing
that tell-tale exclamation of 'Ring and Hand,' and if, in
the talk I held with Mr. Mansell the day before, he had
not betrayed&mdash;&mdash; Why do you stop me?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"I did not stop you," he hastily assured her. "I am
too anxious to hear what you have to say. Go on, Imogene.
What did this Mansell betray? I&mdash;I ask as a
father might," he added, with some dignity and no little
effort.</p>

<p>But her fears had taken alarm, or her caution been
aroused, and she merely said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>"The five thousand dollars which his aunt leaves him
is just the amount he desired to start him in life."</p>

<p>"Did he wish such an amount?" Mr. Orcutt asked.</p>

<p>"Very much."</p>

<p>"And acknowledged it in the conversation he had with
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Imogene," declared the lawyer, "if you do not want
to insure Mr. Mansell's indictment, I would suggest to
you not to lay too great stress upon any <i>talk</i> you may
have held with him."</p>

<p>But she cried with unmoved sternness, and a relentless
crushing down of all emotion that was at once amazing
and painful to see:</p>

<p>"The innocent is to be saved from the gallows, no
matter what the fate of the guilty may be."</p>

<p>And a short but agitated silence followed which Mr.
Orcutt broke at last by saying:</p>

<p>"Are these all the facts you have to give me?"</p>

<p>She started, cast him a quick look, bowed her head,
and replied:</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>There was something in the tone of this assertion that
made him repeat his question.</p>

<p>"Are these <i>all</i> the facts you have to give me?"</p>

<p>Her answer came ringing and emphatic now.</p>

<p>"Yes," she avowed&mdash;"all."</p>

<p>With a look of relief, slowly smoothing out the deep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
furrows of his brow, Mr. Orcutt, for the second time,
walked thoughtfully away in evident consultation with his
own thoughts. This time he was gone so long, the suspense
became almost intolerable to Imogene. Feeling
that she could endure it no longer, she followed him at
last, and laid her hand upon his arm.</p>

<p>"Speak," she impetuously cried. "Tell me what you
think; what I have to expect."</p>

<p>But he shook his head.</p>

<p>"Wait," he returned; "wait till the Grand Jury has
brought in a bill of indictment. It will, doubtless, be
against one of these two men; but I must know which,
before I can say or do any thing."</p>

<p>"And do you think there can be any doubt about
which of these two it will be?" she inquired, with sudden
emotion.</p>

<p>"There is always doubt," he rejoined, "about any thing
or every thing a body of men may do. This is a very
remarkable case, Imogene," he resumed, with increased
sombreness; "the most remarkable one, perhaps, that
has ever come under my observation. What the Grand
Jury will think of it; upon which party, Mansell or Hildreth,
the weight of their suspicion will fall, neither I nor
Ferris, nor any other man, can prophesy with any assurance.
The evidence against both is, in so far as we know,
entirely circumstantial. That you believe Mr. Mansell
to be the guilty party&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Believe!" she murmured; "I know it."</p>

<p>"That you <i>believe</i> him to be the guilty party," the wary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
lawyer pursued, as if he had not heard her "does not
imply that they will believe it too. Hildreth comes of a
bad stock, and his late attempt at suicide tells wonderfully
against him; yet, the facts you have to give in
Mansell's disfavor are strong also, and Heaven only
knows what the upshot will be. However, a few weeks
will determine all that, and then&mdash;&mdash;" Pausing, he
looked at her, and, as he did so, the austerity and self-command
of the lawyer vanished out of sight, and the
passionate gleam of a fierce and overmastering love
shone again in his eyes. "And then," he cried, "then
we will see what Tremont Orcutt can do to bring order
out of this chaos."</p>

<p>There was so much resolve in his look, such a hint of
promise in his tone, that she flushed with something
almost akin to hope.</p>

<p>"Oh, generous&mdash;&mdash;" she began.</p>

<p>But he stopped her before she could say more.</p>

<p>"Wait," he repeated; "wait till we see what action
will be taken by the Grand Jury." And taking her hand,
he looked earnestly, if not passionately, in her face.
"Imogene," he commenced, "if I should succeed&mdash;&mdash;"
But there he himself stopped short with a quick recalling
of his own words, perhaps. "No," he cried, "I will say
no more till we see which of these two men is to be
brought to trial." And, pressing her hand to his lips, he
gave her one last look in which was concentrated all the
secret passions which had been called forth by this hour,
and hastily left the room.</p>

<h2>XXIV.</h2>

<h3>A TRUE BILL.</h3>

<div class='poem'>
Come to me, friend or foe,<br />
And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Henry VI.</span><br />
<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>THE town of Sibley was in a state of excitement.
About the court-house especially the crowd was
great and the interest manifested intense. The Grand
Jury was in session, and the case of the Widow Clemmens
was before it.</div>

<p>As all the proceedings of this body are private, the
suspense of those interested in the issue was naturally
very great. The name of the man lastly suspected of the
crime had transpired, and both Hildreth and Mansell
had their partisans, though the mystery surrounding the
latter made his friends less forward in asserting his innocence
than those of the more thoroughly understood Hildreth.
Indeed, the ignorance felt on all sides as to the
express reasons for associating the name of Mrs. Clemmens'
nephew with his aunt's murder added much to the
significance of the hour. Conjectures were plenty and
the wonder great, but the causes why this man, or any
other, should lie under a suspicion equal to that raised
against Hildreth at the inquest was a mystery that none
could solve.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>But what is the curiosity of the rabble to us? Our interest
is in a little room far removed from this scene of
excitement, where the young daughter of Professor
Darling kneels by the side of Imogene Dare, striving by
caress and entreaty to win a word from her lips or a
glance from her heavy eyes.</p>

<p>"Imogene," she pleaded,&mdash;"Imogene, what is this
terrible grief? Why did you have to go to the court-house
this morning with papa, and why have you been
almost dead with terror and misery ever since you got
back? Tell me, or I shall perish of mere fright. For
weeks now, ever since you were so good as to help me
with my wedding-clothes, I have seen that something
dreadful was weighing upon your mind, but this which
you are suffering now is awful; this I cannot bear. Cannot
you speak dear? Words will do you good."</p>

<p>"Words!"</p>

<p>Oh, the despair, the bitterness of that single exclamation!
Miss Darling drew back in dismay. As if released,
Imogene rose to her feet and surveyed the sweet and ingenuous
countenance uplifted to her own, with a look of
faint recognition of the womanly sympathy it conveyed.</p>

<p>"Helen," she resumed, "you are happy. Don't stay
here with me, but go where there are cheerfulness and
hope."</p>

<p>"But I cannot while you suffer so. I love you,
Imogene. Would you drive me away from your side
when you are so unhappy? You don't care for me as I
do for you or you could not do it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>"Helen!" The deep tone made the sympathetic little
bride-elect quiver. "Helen, some griefs are best
borne alone. Only a few hours now and I shall know
the worst. Leave me."</p>

<p>But the gentle little creature was not to be driven away.
She only clung the closer and pleaded the more earnestly:</p>

<p>"Tell me, tell me!"</p>

<p>The reiteration of this request was too much for the
pallid woman before her. Laying her two hands on the
shoulders of this child, she drew back and looked her earnestly
in the face.</p>

<p>"Helen," she cried, "what do you know of earthly
anguish? A petted child, the favorite of happy fortune,
you have been kept from evil as from a blight. None of
the annoyances of life have been allowed to enter
your path, much less its griefs and sins. Terror with you
is but a name, remorse an unknown sensation. Even
your love has no depths in it such as suffering gives. Yet,
since you do love, and love well, perhaps you can understand
something of what a human soul can endure who
sees its only hope and only love tottering above a gulf
too horrible for words to describe&mdash;a gulf, too, which her
own hand&mdash;&mdash; But no, I cannot tell you. I overrated
my strength. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She sank back, but the next moment started again to
her feet: a servant had opened the door.</p>

<p>"What is it!" she exclaimed; "speak, tell me."</p>

<p>"Only a gentleman to see you, miss."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>"Only a&mdash;&mdash;" But she stopped in that vain repetition
of the girl's simple words, and looked at her as if she
would force from her lips the name she had not the courage
to demand; but, failing to obtain it, turned away to
the glass, where she quietly smoothed her hair and adjusted
the lace at her throat, and then catching sight of
the tear-stained face of Helen, stooped and gave her a
kiss, after which she moved mechanically to the door and
went down those broad flights, one after one, till she came
to the parlor, when she went in and encountered&mdash;Mr.
Orcutt.</p>

<p>A glance at his face told her all she wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she gasped, "it is then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mansell!"</p>

<p>It was five minutes later. Imogene leaned against the
window where she had withdrawn herself at the utterance
of that one word. Mr. Orcutt stood a couple of paces
behind her.</p>

<p>"Imogene," said he, "there is a question I would like
to have you answer."</p>

<p>The feverish agitation expressed in his tone made her
look around.</p>

<p>"Put it," she mechanically replied.</p>

<p>But he did not find it easy to do this, while her eyes
rested upon him in such despair. He felt, however, that
the doubt in his mind must be satisfied at all hazards; so
choking down an emotion that was almost as boundless as
her own, he ventured to ask:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is it among the possibilities that you could ever
again contemplate giving yourself in marriage to Craik
Mansell, no matter what the issue of the coming trial may
be?"</p>

<p>A shudder quick and powerful as that which follows the
withdrawal of a dart from an agonizing wound shook her
whole frame for a moment, but she answered, steadily:</p>

<p>"No; how can you ask, Mr. Orcutt?"</p>

<p>A gleam of relief shot across his somewhat haggard
features.</p>

<p>"Then," said he, "it will be no treason in me to assure
you that never has my love been greater for you than to-day.
That to save you from the pain which you are suffering,
I would sacrifice every thing, even my pride. If,
therefore, there is any kindness I can show you, any deed
I can perform for your sake, I am ready to attempt it,
Imogene.</p>

<p>"Would you&mdash;" she hesitated, but gathered courage
as she met his eye&mdash;"would you be willing to go to him
with a message from me?"</p>

<p>His glance fell and his lips took a line that startled
Imogene, but his answer, though given with bitterness
was encouraging.</p>

<p>"Yes," he returned; "even that."</p>

<p>"Then," she cried, "tell him that to save the innocent,
I had to betray the guilty, but in doing this I did not
spare myself; that whatever his doom may be, I shall
share it, even though it be that of death."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>"Imogene!"</p>

<p>"Will you tell him?" she asked.</p>

<p>But he would not have been a man, much less a lover,
if he could answer that question now. Seizing her by the
arm, he looked her wildly in the face.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to kill yourself?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I feel I shall not live," she gasped, while her hand
went involuntarily to her heart.</p>

<p>He gazed at her in horror.</p>

<p>"And if he is cleared?" he hoarsely ejaculated.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I shall try to endure my fate."</p>

<p>He gave her another long, long look.</p>

<p>"So this is the alternative you give me?" he bitterly
exclaimed. "I must either save this man or see you
perish. Well," he declared, after a few minutes' further
contemplation of her face, "I will save this man&mdash;that is,
if he will allow me to do so."</p>

<p>A flash of joy such as he had not perceived on her
countenance for weeks transformed its marble-like severity
into something of its pristine beauty.</p>

<p>"And you will take him my message also?" she cried.</p>

<p>But to this he shook his head.</p>

<p>"If I am to approach him as a lawyer willing to undertake
his cause, don't you see I can give him no such
message as that?"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, yes. But you can tell him Imogene Dare
has risked her own life and happiness to save the innocent."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will tell him whatever I can to show your pity and
your misery."</p>

<p>And she had to content herself with this. In the light
of the new hope that was thus unexpectedly held out to
her, it did not seem so difficult. Giving Mr. Orcutt her
hand, she endeavored to thank him, but the reaction from
her long suspense was too much, and, for the first time
in her brave young life, Imogene lost consciousness and
fainted quite away.</p>

<h3>AMONG TELESCOPES AND CHARTS.</h3>

<div class='center'>
Tarry a little&mdash;there is something else.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Merchant of Venice.</span><br />
<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>GOUVERNEUR HILDRETH was discharged
and Craik Mansell committed to prison to await
his trial.</div>

<p>Horace Byrd, who no longer had any motive for remaining
in Sibley, had completed all his preparations to
return to New York. His valise was packed, his adieus
made, and nothing was left for him to do but to step
around to the station, when he bethought him of a certain
question he had not put to Hickory.</p>

<p>Seeking him out, he propounded it.</p>

<p>"Hickory," said he, "have you ever discovered in the
course of your inquiries where Miss Dare was on the
morning of the murder?"</p>

<p>The stalwart detective, who was in a very contented
frame of mind, answered up with great cheeriness:</p>

<p>"Haven't I, though! It was one of the very first
things I made sure of. She was at Professor Darling's
house on Summer Avenue."</p>

<p>"At Professor Darling's house?" Mr. Byrd felt a
sensation of dismay. Professor Darling's house was, as
you remember, in almost direct communication with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
Mrs. Clemmens' cottage by means of a path through the
woods. As Mr. Byrd recalled his first experience in
threading those woods, and remembered with what suddenness
he had emerged from them only to find himself
in full view of the West Side and Professor Darling's
spacious villa, he stared uneasily at his colleague and
said:</p>

<p>"It is train time, Hickory, but I cannot help that.
Before I leave this town I must know just what she was
doing on that morning, and whom she was with. Can
you find out?"</p>

<p>"<i>Can I find out?</i>"</p>

<p>The hardy detective was out of the door before the
last word of this scornful repetition had left his lips.</p>

<p>He was gone an hour. When he returned he looked
very much excited.</p>

<p>"Well!" he ejaculated, breathlessly, "I have had an
experience."</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd gave him a look, saw something he did not
like in his face, and moved uneasily in his chair.</p>

<p>"You have?" he retorted. "What is it? Speak."</p>

<p>"Do you know," the other resumed, "that the hardest
thing I ever had to do was to keep my head down in the
hut the other day, and deny myself a look at the woman
who could bear herself so bravely in the midst of a scene
so terrible. Well," he went on, "I have to-day been rewarded
for my self-control. I have seen Miss Dare."</p>

<p>Horace Byrd could scarcely restrain his impatience.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where?" he demanded. "How? Tell a fellow,
can't you?"</p>

<p>"I am going to," protested Hickory. "Cannot you
wait a minute? <i>I</i> had to wait forty. Well," he continued
more pleasantly as he saw the other frown, "I
went to Professor Darling's. There is a girl there I have
talked to before, and I had no difficulty in seeing her or
getting a five minutes' chat with her at the back-gate.
Odd how such girls will talk! She told me in three
minutes all I wanted to know. Not that it was so much,
only&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do get on," interrupted Mr. Byrd. "When did Miss
Dare come to the house on the morning Mrs. Clemmens
was murdered, and what did she do while there?"</p>

<p>"She came early; by ten o'clock or so, I believe, and
she sat, if she did sit, in an observatory they have at the
top of the house: a place where she often used to go, I
am told, to study astronomy with Professor Darling's
oldest daughter."</p>

<p>"And was Miss Darling with her that morning? Did
they study together all the time she was in the house?"</p>

<p>"No; that is, the girl said no one went up to the observatory
with Miss Dare; that Miss Darling did not
happen to be at home that day, and Miss Dare had to
study alone. Hearing this," pursued Hickory, answering
the look of impatience in the other's face, "I had a
curiosity to interview the observatory, and being&mdash;well,
not a clumsy fellow at softsoaping a girl&mdash;I at last succeeded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
in prevailing upon her to take me up. Byrd, will
you believe me when I tell you that we did it without going
into the house?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I mean," corrected the other, "without entering the
main part of the building. The professor's house has a
tower, you know, at the upper angle toward the woods,
and it is in the top of that tower he keeps his telescopes
and all that kind of thing. The tower has a special
staircase of its own. It is a spiral one, and opens on
a door below that connects directly with the garden.
We went up these stairs."</p>

<p>"You dared to?"</p>

<p>"Yes; the girl assured me every one was out of the
house but the servants, and I believed her. We went up
the stairs, entered the observatory&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is not kept locked, then?"</p>

<p>"It was not locked to-day&mdash;saw the room, which is a
curious one&mdash;glanced out over the view, which is well
worth seeing, and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, what?"</p>

<p>"I believe I stood still and asked the girl a question or
two more. I inquired," he went on, deprecating the
other's impatience by a wave of his nervous hand, "when
Miss Dare came down from this place on the morning
you remember. She answered that she couldn't quite
tell; that she wouldn't have remembered any thing about
it at all, only that Miss Tremaine came to the house that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
morning, and wanting to see Miss Dare, ordered her to
go up to the observatory and tell that lady to come down,
and that she went, but to her surprise did not find Miss
Dare there, though she was sure she had not gone home,
or, at least, hadn't taken any of the cars that start from
the front of the house, for she had looked at them every
one as they went by the basement window where she was
at work."</p>

<p>"The girl said this?"</p>

<p>"Yes, standing in the door of this small room, and
looking me straight in the eye."</p>

<p>"And did you ask her nothing more? Say nothing about
the time, Hickory, or&mdash;or inquire where she supposed
Miss Dare to have gone?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I asked her all this. I am not without curiosity
any more than you are, Mr. Byrd."</p>

<p>"And she replied?"</p>

<p>"Oh, as to the time, that it was somewhere before noon.
Her reason for being sure of this was that Miss Tremaine
declined to wait till another effort had been made to find
Miss Dare, saying she had an engagement at twelve which
she did not wish to break."</p>

<p>"And the girl's notions about where Miss Dare had
gone?"</p>

<p>"Such as you expect, Byrd. She said she did not
know any thing about it, but that Miss Dare often went
strolling in the garden, or even in the woods when she
came to Professor Darling's house, and that she supposed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
she had gone off on some such walk at this time, for, at
one o'clock or thereabouts, she saw her pass in the
horse-car on her way back to the town."</p>

<p>"Hickory, I wish you had not told me this just as I am
going back to the city."</p>

<p>"Wish I had not told it, or wish I had not gone to
Professor Darling's house as you requested?"</p>

<p>"Wish you had not told it. I dare not wish the other.
But you spoke of seeing Miss Dare; how was that?
Where did you run across her?"</p>

<p>"Do you want to hear?"</p>

<p>"Of course, of course."</p>

<p>"But I thought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind, old boy; tell me the whole now, as
long as you have told me any. Was she in the
house?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you. I had asked the girl all these questions,
as I have said, and was about to leave the observatory
and go below when I thought I would cast another
glance around the curious old place, and in doing so
caught a glimpse of a huge portfolio of charts, as I
supposed, standing upright in a rack that stretched
across the further portion of the room. Somehow my
heart misgave me when I saw this rack, and, scarcely
conscious what it was I feared, I crossed the floor and
looked behind the portfolio. Byrd, there was a woman
crouched there&mdash;a woman whose pallid cheeks and
burning eyes lifted to meet my own, told me only too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
plainly that it was Miss Dare. I have had many experiences,"
Hickory allowed, after a moment, "and
some of them any thing but pleasant to myself, but I
don't think I ever felt just as I did at that instant. I
believe I attempted a bow&mdash;I don't remember; or, at
least, tried to murmur some excuse, but the look that
came into her face paralyzed me, and I stopped before
I had gotten very far, and waited to hear what she
would say. But she did not say much; she merely
rose, and, turning toward me, exclaimed: 'No apologies;
you are a detective, I suppose?' And when I
nodded, or made some other token that she had guessed
correctly, she merely remarked, flashing upon me, however,
in a way I do not yet understand: 'Well, you
have got what you desired, and now can go.' And I
went, Byrd, went; and I felt puzzled, I don't know
why, and a little bit sore about the heart, too, as
if&mdash;&mdash; Well, I can't even tell what I mean by that <i>if</i>.
The only thing I am sure of is, that Mansell's cause
hasn't been helped by this day's job, and that if this
lady is asked on the witness stand where she was during
the hour every one believed her to be safely shut
up with the telescopes and charts, we shall hear&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Well, that she <i>was</i> shut up with them, most likely.
Women like her are not to be easily disconcerted even on
the witness stand."</p>

<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>THE time is midnight, the day the same as that
which saw this irruption of Hickory into Professor
Darling's observatory; the scene that of Miss
Dare's own room in the northeast tower. She is standing
before a table with a letter in her hand and a look
upon her face that, if seen, would have added much to
the puzzlement of the detectives.</div>

<p>The letter was from Mr. Orcutt and ran thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I have seen Mr. Mansell, and have engaged myself to undertake
his defence. When I tell you that out of the hundreds of cases I
have tried in my still short life, I have lost but a small percentage,
you will understand what this means.</p>

<p>In pursuance to your wishes, I mentioned your name to the
prisoner with an intimation that I had a message from you to deliver.
But he stopped me before I could utter a word. "I receive no communication
from Miss Dare!" he declared, and, anxious as I really
was to do your bidding, I was compelled to refrain; for his tone was
one of hatred and his look that of ineffable scorn.</p></div>

<p>This was all, but it was enough. Imogene had read
these words over three times, and now was ready to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
plunge the letter into the flame of a candle to destroy it.
As it burned, her grief and indignation took words:</p>

<p>"He is alienated, completely alienated," she gasped;
"and I do not wonder. But," and here the full majesty
of her nature broke forth in one grand gesture, "he shall
hear me yet! As there is a God above, he shall hear me
yet, even if it has to be in the open court and in the
presence of judge and jury!"</p>

Too hideous to be shown.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Othello.</span><br />
<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>SIBLEY was in a stir. Sibley was the central point
of interest for the whole country. The great trial
was in progress and the curiosity of the populace knew
no bounds.</div>

<p>In a room of the hotel sat our two detectives. They
had just come from the court-house. Both seemed inclined
to talk, though both showed an indisposition to
open the conversation. A hesitation lay between them;
a certain thin vail of embarrassment that either one would
have found it hard to explain, and yet which sufficed to
make their intercourse a trifle uncertain in its character,
though Hickory's look had lost none of its rude good-humor,
and Byrd's manner was the same mixture of easy
nonchalance and quiet self-possession it had always been.</p>

<p>It was Hickory who spoke at last.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, Byrd?" was his suggestive exclamation.</p>

<p>"Well, Hickory?" was the quiet reply.</p>

<p>"What do you think of the case so far?"</p>

<p>"I think"&mdash;the words came somewhat slowly&mdash;"I
think that it looks bad. Bad for the prisoner, I mean,"
he explained the next moment with a quick flush.</p>

<p>"Your sympathies are evidently with Mansell,"
Hickory quietly remarked.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the slow reply. "Not that I think him innocent,
or would turn a hair's breadth from the truth to
serve him."</p>

<p>"He <i>is</i> a manly fellow," Hickory bluntly admitted,
after a moment's puff at the pipe he was smoking.
"Do you remember the peculiar straightforwardness of
his look when he uttered his plea of 'Not guilty,' and the
tone he used too, so quiet, yet so emphatic? You could
have heard a pin drop."</p>

<p>"Yes," returned Mr. Byrd, with a quick contraction of
his usually smooth brow.</p>

<p>"Have you noticed," the other broke forth, after
another puff, "a certain curious air of disdain that he
wears?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was again the short reply.</p>

<p>"I wonder what it means?" queried Hickory carelessly,
knocking the ashes out of his pipe.</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd flashed a quick askance look at his colleague
from under his half-fallen lids, but made no
answer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is not pride alone," resumed the rough-and-ready
detective, half-musingly; "though he's as proud as the
best of 'em. Neither is it any sort of make-believe, or <i>I</i>
wouldn't be caught by it. 'Tis&mdash;'tis&mdash;what?" And
Hickory rubbed his nose with his thoughtful forefinger,
and looked inquiringly at Mr. Byrd.</p>

<p>"How should I know?" remarked the other, tossing
his stump of a cigar into the fire. "Mr. Mansell is too
deep a problem for me."</p>

<p>"And Miss Dare too?"</p>

<p>"<i>And</i> Miss Dare."</p>

<p>Silence followed this admission, which Hickory broke
at last by observing:</p>

<p>"The day that sees <i>her</i> on the witness stand will be interesting,
eh?"</p>

<p>"It is not far off," declared Mr. Byrd.</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>"I think she will be called as a witness to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Have you noticed," began Hickory again, after another
short interval of quiet contemplation, "that it is
only when Miss Dare is present that Mansell wears the
look of scorn I have just mentioned."</p>

<p>"Hickory," said Mr. Byrd, wheeling directly about in
his chair and for the first time surveying his colleague
squarely, "I have noticed <i>this</i>. That ever since the day
she made her first appearance in the court-room, she has
sat with her eyes fixed earnestly upon the prisoner, and
that he has never answered her look by so much as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
glance in her direction. This has but one explanation as
I take it. He never forgets that it is through her he has
been brought to trial for his life."</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd uttered this very distinctly, and with a decided
emphasis. But the impervious Hickory only settled himself
farther back in his chair, and stretching his feet out
toward the fire, remarked dryly:</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am not much of a judge of human nature,
but I should have said now that this Mansell was not
a man to treat her contemptuously for that. Rage he
might show or hatred, but this quiet ignoring of her
presence seems a little too dignified for a criminal facing
a person he has every reason to believe is convinced
of his guilt."</p>

<p>"Ordinary rules don't apply to this man. Neither you
nor I can sound his nature. If he displays contempt, it
is because he is of the sort to feel it for the woman who
has betrayed him."</p>

<p>"You make him out mean-spirited, then, as well
as wicked?"</p>

<p>"I make him out human. More than that," Mr. Byrd
resumed, after a moment's thought, "I make him out consistent.
A man who lets his passions sway him to the extent
of committing a murder for the purpose of satisfying
his love or his ambition, is not of the unselfish cast that
would appreciate such a sacrifice as Miss Dare has made.
This under the supposition that our reasons for believing
him guilty are well founded. If our suppositions are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
false, and the crime was not committed by him, his contempt
needs no explanation."</p>

<p>"Just so!"</p>

<p>The peculiar tone in which this was uttered caused Mr.
Byrd to flash another quick look at his colleague.
Hickory did not seem to observe it.</p>

<p>"What makes you think Miss Dare will be called
to the witness stand to-morrow?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Well I will tell you," returned Byrd, with the sudden
vivacity of one glad to turn the current of conversation
into a fresh channel. "If you have followed the method
of the prosecution as I have done, you will have noticed
that it has advanced to its point by definite stages.
First, witnesses were produced to prove the existence of
motive on the part of the accused. Mr. Goodman
was called to the witness stand, and, after him, other
business men of Buffalo, all of whom united in unqualified
assertions of the prisoner's frequently-expressed desire for
a sum of money sufficient to put his invention into
practical use. Next, the amount considered necessary
for this purpose was ascertained and found to be just
covered by the legacy bequeathed him by his aunt; after
which, ample evidence was produced to show that he
knew the extent of her small fortune, and the fact
that she had by her will made him her heir. Motive for
the crime being thus established, they now proceeded to
prove that he was not without actual opportunity for perpetrating
it. He was shown to have been in Sibley at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
time of the murder. The station-master at Monteith was
confronted with the prisoner, also old Sally Perkins.
Then you and I came before the court with our testimony,
and whatever doubt may have remained as to his
having been in a position to effect his aunt's death,
and afterward escape unnoticed by means of the path
leading over the hills to Monteith Quarry station, was
swept away. What remains? To connect him with the
murder itself, by some, strong link of circumstantial evidence,
such as the ring provides. And who is it that
can give testimony regarding the ring?&mdash;Miss Dare."</p>

<p>"Hem! Well, she will do it," was the dry remark of
Hickory.</p>

<p>"She will be obliged to do it," was the emphatic response
of Byrd.</p>

<p>And again their glances crossed in a furtive way both
seemed ready to ignore.</p>

<p>"What do you think of Orcutt?" Hickory next inquired.</p>

<p>"He is very quiet."</p>

<p>"Too quiet, eh?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps. Folks that know him well declare they
never before saw him conduct a case in so temperate a
manner. He has scarcely made an effort at cross-examination,
and, in fact, has thus far won nothing for the
defence except that astonishing tribute to the prisoner's
character given by Mr. Goodman."</p>

<p>"Mr. Goodman is Mansell's friend."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know it; but his short, decisive statements told
upon the jury. Such a man as he made Mansell out to
be is just the sort to create an impression on a body of
men like them."</p>

<p>"Orcutt understands a jury."</p>

<p>"Orcutt understands his case. He knows he can
make nothing by attempting to shake the evidence which
has been presented by the prosecution; the facts are too
clear, and the witnesses which have been called to testify
are of too reliable a character. Whatever defence he
contemplates, it will not rest upon a denial of any of the
facts brought to light through our efforts, or the evidence
of such persons as Messrs. Goodman and Harrison."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"The question is, then, in what will it lie? Some
strong point, I warrant you, or he would not hold himself
and his plans so completely in reserve. But what strong
point? I acknowledge the uncertainty troubles me."</p>

<p>"I don't wonder," rejoined Hickory. "So it does
me."</p>

<p>And a constraint again fell between them that lasted
till Hickory put his pipe in his pocket and signified his
intention of returning to his own apartments.</p>

<h3>THE CHIEF WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION.</h3>

<div class='poem'>
Oh, while you live tell truth and shame the devil!<br />
<div class='sig'>
&mdash;<span class="smcap">Henry IV.</span></div><br />
<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>MR. BYRD'S countenance after the departure of
his companion was any thing but cheerful. The
fact is, he was secretly uneasy. He dreaded the morrow.
He dreaded the testimony of Miss Dare. He had not yet
escaped so fully from under the dominion of her fascinations
as to regard with equanimity this unhappy woman
forcing herself to give testimony compromising to the
man she loved.</div>

<p>Yet when the morrow came he was among the first to
secure a seat in the court-room. Though the scene was
likely to be harrowing to his feelings, he had no wish to
lose it, and, indeed, chose such a position as would give
him the best opportunity for observing the prisoner and
surveying the witnesses.</p>

<p>He was not the only one on the look-out for the testimony
of Miss Dare. The increased number of the spectators
and the general air of expectation visible in more
than one of the chief actors in this terrible drama gave
suspicious proof of the fact; even if the deadly pallor of
the lady herself had not revealed her own feelings in
regard to the subject.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>The entrance of the prisoner was more marked, too,
than usual. His air and manner were emphasized, so to
speak, and his face, when he turned it toward the jury,
wore an iron look of resolution that would have made
him conspicuous had he occupied a less prominent position
than that of the dock.</p>

<p>Miss Dare, who had flashed her eyes toward him at the
moment of his first appearance, dropped them again, contrary
to her usual custom. Was it because she knew the
moment was at hand when their glances would be obliged
to meet?</p>

<p>Mr. Orcutt, whom no movement on the part of Miss
Dare ever escaped, leaned over and spoke to the prisoner.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mansell," said he, "are you prepared to submit
with composure to the ordeal of confronting Miss Dare?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the stern reply.</p>

<p>"I would then advise you to look at her now," proceeded
his counsel. "She is not turned this way, and
you can observe her without encountering her glance. A
quick look at this moment may save you from betraying
any undue emotion when you see her upon the stand."</p>

<p>The accused smiled with a bitterness Mr. Orcutt
thought perfectly natural, and slowly prepared to obey.
As he raised his eyes and allowed them to traverse the
room until they settled upon the countenance of the
woman he loved, this other man who, out of a still more
absorbing passion for Imogene, was at that very moment
doing all that lay in his power for the saving of this his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
openly acknowledged rival, watched him with the closest
and most breathless attention. It was another instance
of that peculiar fascination which a successful rival has
for an unsuccessful one. It was as if this great lawyer's
thoughts reverted to his love, and he asked himself:
"What is there in this Mansell that she should prefer him
to me?"</p>

<p>And Orcutt himself, though happily unaware of the
fact, was at that same instant under a scrutiny as narrow
as that he bestowed upon his client. Mr. Ferris, who
knew his secret, felt a keen interest in watching how he
would conduct himself at this juncture. Not an expression
of the lawyer's keen and puzzling eye but was seen
by the District Attorney and noted, even if it was not
understood.</p>

<p>Of the three, Mr. Ferris was the first to turn away, and
his thoughts if they could have been put into words might
have run something like this: "That man"&mdash;meaning
Orcutt&mdash;"is doing the noblest work one human being
can perform for another, and yet there is something in his
face I do not comprehend. Can it be he hopes to win
Miss Dare by his effort to save his rival?"</p>

<p>As for the thoughts of the person thus unconsciously
subjected to the criticism of his dearest friend, let our
knowledge of the springs that govern his action serve to
interpret both the depth and bitterness of his curiosity;
while the sentiments of Mansell&mdash;&mdash; But who can read
what lurks behind the iron of that sternly composed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
countenance? Not Imogene, not Orcutt, not Ferris.
His secret, if he owns one, he keeps well, and his lids
scarcely quiver as he drops them over the eyes that but a
moment before reflected the grand beauty of the unfortunate
woman for whom he so lately protested the most
fervent love.</p>

<p>The next moment the court was opened and Miss
Dare's name was called by the District Attorney.</p>

<p>With a last look at the unresponsive prisoner, Imogene
rose, took her place on the witness stand and faced the
jury.</p>

<p>It was a memorable moment. If the curious and impressible
crowd of spectators about her had been ignorant
of her true relations to the accused, the deadly
stillness and immobility of her bearing would have convinced
them that emotion of the deepest nature lay
behind the still, white mask she had thought fit to assume.
That she was beautiful and confronted them from that
common stand as from a throne, did not serve to lessen
the impression she made.</p>

<p>The officer held the Bible toward her. With a look
that Mr. Byrd was fain to consider one of natural shrinking
only, she laid her white hand upon it; but at the intimation
from the officer, "The right hand, if you please,
miss," she started and made the exchange he suggested,
while at the same moment there rang upon her ear the
voice of the clerk as he administered the awful adjuration
that she should, as she believed and hoped in Eternal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
mercy, tell the truth as between this man and the law and
keep not one tittle back. The book was then lifted to her
lips by the officer, and withdrawn.</p>

<p>"Take your seat, Miss Dare," said the District Attorney.
And the examination began.</p>

<p>"Your name, if you please?"</p>

<p>"Imogene Dare."</p>

<p>"Are you married or single?"</p>

<p>"I am single."</p>

<p>"Where were you born?"</p>

<p>Now this was a painful question to one of her history.
Indeed, she showed it to be so by the flush which rose to
her cheek and by the decided trembling of her proud lip.
But she did not seek to evade it.</p>

<p>"Sir," she said, "I cannot answer you. I never heard
any of the particulars of my birth. I was a foundling."</p>

<p>The mingled gentleness and dignity with which she
made this acknowledgment won for her the instantaneous
sympathy of all present. Mr. Orcutt saw this, and
the flash of indignation that had involuntarily passed
between him and the prisoner subsided as quickly as it
arose.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris went on.</p>

<p>"Where do you live?"</p>

<p>"In this town?"</p>

<p>"With whom do you live?"</p>

<p>"I am boarding <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'a'">at</ins> present with a woman of the name
of Kennedy. I support myself by my needle," she hurriedly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
added, as though anxious to forestall his next
question.</p>

<p>Seeing the prisoner start at this, Imogene lifted her
head still higher. Evidently this former lover of hers
knew little of her movements since they parted so many
weeks ago.</p>

<p>"And how long is it since you supported yourself in
this way?" asked the District Attorney.</p>

<p>"For a few weeks only. Formerly," she said, making
a slight inclination in the direction of the prisoner's
counsel, "I lived in the household of Mr. Orcutt, where
I occupied the position of assistant to the lady who looks
after his domestic affairs." And her eye met the
lawyer's with a look of pride that made him inwardly
cringe, though not even the jealous glance of the prisoner
could detect that an eyelash quivered or a flicker disturbed
the studied serenity of his gaze.</p>

<p>The District Attorney opened his lips as if to pursue
this topic, but, meeting his opponent's eye, concluded to
waive further preliminaries and proceed at once to the
more serious part of the examination.</p>

<p>"Miss Dare," said he, "will you look at the prisoner
and tell us if you have any acquaintance with him?"</p>

<p>Slowly she prepared to reply; slowly she turned her
head and let her glance traverse that vast crowd till it
settled upon her former lover. The look which passed
like lightning across her face as she encountered his gaze
fixed for the first time steadily upon her own, no one in
that assemblage ever forgot.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," she returned, quietly, but in a tone that made
Mansell quiver and look away, despite his iron self-command;
"I know him."</p>

<p>"Will you be kind enough to say how long you have
known him and where it was you first made his acquaintance?"</p>

<p>"I met him first in Buffalo some four months since,"
was the steady reply. "He was calling at a friend's
house where I was staying."</p>

<p>"Did you at that time know of his relation to your
townswoman, Mrs. Clemmens?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. It was not till I had seen him several
times that I learned he had any connections in Sibley."</p>

<p>"Miss Dare, you will excuse me, but it is highly
desirable for the court to know if the prisoner ever paid
his addresses to you?"</p>

<p>The deep, almost agonizing blush that colored her
white cheek answered as truly as the slow "Yes," that
struggled painfully to her lips.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;excuse me again, Miss Dare&mdash;did he propose
marriage to you?"</p>

<p>"He did."</p>

<p>"Did you accept him?"</p>

<p>"I did not."</p>

<p>"Did you refuse him?"</p>

<p>"I refused to engage myself to him."</p>

<p>"Miss Dare, will you tell us when you left Buffalo?"</p>

<p>"On the nineteenth day of August last."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did the prisoner accompany you?"</p>

<p>"He did not."</p>

<p>"Upon what sort of terms did you part?"</p>

<p>"Good terms, sir."</p>

<p>"Do you mean friendly terms, or such as are held by
a man and a woman between whom an attachment exists
which, under favorable circumstances, may culminate in
marriage?"</p>

<p>"The latter, sir, I think."</p>

<p>"Did you receive any letters from the prisoner after
your return to Sibley?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And did you answer them?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"Miss Dare, may I now ask what reasons you gave
the prisoner for declining his offer&mdash;that is, if my friend
does not object to the question?" added the District
Attorney, turning with courtesy toward Mr. Orcutt.</p>

<p>The latter, who had started to his feet, bowed composedly
and prepared to resume his seat.</p>

<p>"I desire to put nothing in the way of your eliciting
the whole truth concerning this matter," was his
quiet, if somewhat constrained, response.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris at once turned back to Miss Dare.</p>

<p>"You will, then, answer," he said.</p>

<p>Imogene lifted her head and complied.</p>

<p>"I told him," she declared, with thrilling distinctness,
"that he was in no condition to marry. I am by nature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
an ambitious woman, and, not having suffered at that
time, thought more of my position before the world
than of what constitutes the worth and dignity of
a man."</p>

<p>No one who heard these words could doubt they were
addressed to the prisoner. Haughtily as she held herself,
there was a deprecatory humility in her tone
that neither judge nor jury could have elicited from her.
Naturally many eyes turned in the direction of the
prisoner. They saw two white faces before them, that of
the accused and that of his counsel, who sat near him.
But the pallor of the one was of scorn, and that of the
other&mdash;&mdash; Well, no one who knew the relations of Mr.
Orcutt to the witness could wonder that the renowned
lawyer shrank from hearing the woman he loved confess
her partiality for another man.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris, who understood the situation as well as any
one, but who had passed the point where sympathy could
interfere with his action, showed a disposition to press his
advantage.</p>

<p>"Miss Dare," he inquired, "in declining the proposals
of the prisoner, did you state to him in so many words
these objections you have here mentioned?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"And what answer did he give you?"</p>

<p>"He replied that he was also ambitious, and hoped and
intended to make a success in life."</p>

<p>"And did he tell you how he hoped and intended
to make a success?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>"He did."</p>

<p>"Miss Dare, were these letters written by you?"</p>

<p>She looked at the packet he held toward her, started
as she saw the broad black ribbon that encircled it, and
bowed her head.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt these are my letters," she rejoined,
a little tremulously for her. And unbinding the packet,
she examined its contents. "Yes," she answered, "they
are. These letters were all written by me."</p>

<p>And she handed them back with such haste that
the ribbon which bound them remained in her fingers,
where consciously or unconsciously she held it clutched
all through the remaining time of her examination.</p>

<p>"Now," said the District Attorney, "I propose to read
two of these letters. Does my friend wish to look at
them before I offer them in evidence?" holding them out
to Mr. Orcutt.</p>

<p>Every eye in the court-room was fixed upon the latter's
face, as the letters addressed to his rival by the woman he
wished to make his wife, were tendered in this public
manner to his inspection. Even the iron face of Mansell
relaxed into an expression of commiseration as he turned
and surveyed the man who, in despite of the anomalous
position they held toward each other, was thus engaged
in battling for his life before the eyes of the whole
world. At that instant there was not a spectator who
did not feel that Tremont Orcutt was the hero of the
moment.</p>

<p>He slowly turned to the prisoner:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you any objection to these letters being
read?"</p>

<p>"No," returned the other, in a low tone.</p>

<p>Mr. Orcutt turned firmly to the District Attorney:</p>

<p>"You may read them if you think proper," said he.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris bowed; the letters were marked as exhibits
by the stenographic reporter who was taking the
minutes of testimony, and handed back to Ferris, who
proceeded to read the following in a clear voice to
the jury:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'>
"<span class="smcap">Sibley, N. Y.</span>, September 7, 1882.<br />
</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;You show signs of impatience, and ask for a
word to help you through this period of uncertainty and unrest. What
can I say more than I have said? That I believe in you and in your
invention, and proudly wait for the hour when you will come to
claim me with the fruit of your labors in your hand. I am impatient
myself, but I have more trust than you. Some one will see the value
of your work before long, or else your aunt will interest herself in
your success, and lend you that practical assistance which you need
to start you in the way of fortune and fame. I cannot think you are
going to fail. I will not allow myself to look forward to any thing
less than success for you and happiness for myself. For the one involves
the other, as you must know by this time, or else believe me
to be the most heartless of coquettes.</p>

<p>"Wishing to see you, but of the opinion that further meetings
between us would be unwise till our future looks more settled, I remain,
hopefully yours,</p>

<div class='sig'>
"<span class="smcap">Imogene Dare.</span>"<br />
</div></div>

<p>"The other letter I propose to read," continued Mr.
Ferris, "is dated September 23d, three days before the
widow's death.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Craik</span>,&mdash;Since you insist upon seeing me, and say that you
have reasons of your own for not visiting me openly, I will consent to
meet you at the trysting spot you mention, though all such underhand
dealings are as foreign to my nature as I believe them to be to
yours.</p>

<p>"Trusting that fortune will so favor us as to make it unnecessary
for us to meet in this way more than once, I wait in anxiety for your
coming.</p>

<div class='sig'>
"<span class="smcap">Imogene Dare.</span>"<br />
</div></div>

<p>These letters, unfolding relations that, up to this time,
had been barely surmised by the persons congregated
before her, created a great impression. To those especially
who knew her and believed her to be engaged to Mr.
Orcutt the surprise was wellnigh thrilling. The witness
seemed to feel this, and bestowed a short, quick glance
upon the lawyer, that may have partially recompensed
him for the unpleasantness of the general curiosity.</p>

<p>The Prosecuting Attorney went on without pause:</p>

<p>"Miss Dare," said he, "did you meet the prisoner as
you promised?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"Will you tell me when and where?"</p>

<p>"On the afternoon of Monday, September 27th, in the
glade back of Mrs. Clemmens' house."</p>

<p>"Miss Dare, we fully realize the pain it must cost you
to refer to these matters, but I must request you to tell us
what passed between you at this interview?"</p>

<p>"If you will ask me questions, sir, I will answer them
with the truth the subject demands."</p>

<p>The sorrowful dignity with which this was said, called
forth a bow from the Prosecuting Attorney.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very well," he rejoined, "did the prisoner have any
thing to say about his prospects?"</p>

<p>"He did."</p>

<p>"How did he speak of them?"</p>

<p>"Despondingly."</p>

<p>"And what reason did he give for this?"</p>

<p>"He said he had failed to interest any capitalist in his
invention."</p>

<p>"Any other reason?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What was that?"</p>

<p>"That he had just come from his aunt whom he had
tried to persuade to advance him a sum of money to
carry out his wishes, but that she had refused."</p>

<p>"He told you that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Did he also tell you what path he had taken to his
aunt's house?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Was there any thing said by him to show he did not
take the secret path through the woods and across the
bog to her back door?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Or that he did not return in the same way?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Miss Dare, did the prisoner express to you at this
time irritation as well as regret at the result of his efforts
to elicit money from his aunt?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the evidently forced reply.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can you remember any words that he used which
would tend to show the condition of his mind?"</p>

<p>"I have no memory for words," she began, but flushed
as she met the eye of the Judge, and perhaps remembered
her oath. "I do recollect, however, one expression he
used. He said: 'My life is worth nothing to me without
success. If only to win you, I must put this matter
through; and I will do it yet.'"</p>

<p>She repeated this quietly, giving it no emphasis and
scarcely any inflection, as if she hoped by her mechanical
way of uttering it to rob it of any special meaning. But
she did not succeed, as was shown by the compassionate
tone in which Mr. Ferris next addressed her.</p>

<p>"Miss Dare, did you express any anger yourself at the
refusal of Mrs. Clemmens to assist the prisoner by lending
him such moneys as he required?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I fear I did. It seemed unreasonable to me
then, and I was very anxious he should have that opportunity
to make fame and fortune which I thought his
genius merited."</p>

<p>"Miss Dare," inquired the District Attorney, calling
to his aid such words as he had heard from old Sally in
reference to this interview, "did you make use of any
such expression as this: 'I wish I knew Mrs. Clemmens'?"</p>

<p>"I believe I did."</p>

<p>"And did this mean you had no acquaintance with the
murdered woman at that time?" pursued Mr. Ferris,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
half-turning to the prisoner's counsel, as if he anticipated
the objection which that gentleman might very properly
make to a question concerning the intention of a witness.</p>

<p>And Mr. Orcutt, yielding to professional instinct, did
indeed make a slight movement as if to rise, but became
instantly motionless. Nothing could be more painful to
him than to wrangle before the crowded court-room over
these dealings between the woman he loved and the man
he was now defending.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris turned back to the witness and awaited her
answer. It came without hesitation.</p>

<p>"It meant that, sir."</p>

<p>"And what did the prisoner say when you gave utterance
to this wish?"</p>

<p>"He asked me why I desired to know her."</p>

<p>"And what did you reply?"</p>

<p>"That if I knew her I might be able to persuade her to
listen to his request."</p>

<p>"And what answer had he for this?"</p>

<p>"None but a quick shake of his head."</p>

<p>"Miss Dare; up to the time of this interview had you
ever received any gift from the prisoner&mdash;jewelry, for instance&mdash;say,
a ring!"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Did he offer you such a gift then?"</p>

<p>"He did."</p>

<p>"What was it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>"A gold ring set with a diamond."</p>

<p>"Did you receive it?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. I felt that in taking a ring from him I would
be giving an irrevocable promise, and I was not ready to
do that."</p>

<p>"Did you allow him to put it on your finger?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"And it remained there?" suggested Mr. Ferris, with
a smile.</p>

<p>"A minute, may be."</p>

<p>"Which of you, then, took it off?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"And what did you say when you took it off?"</p>

<p>"I do not remember my words."</p>

<p>Again recalling old Sally's account of this interview,
Mr. Ferris asked:</p>

<p>"Were they these: 'I cannot. Wait till to-morrow'?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe they were."</p>

<p>"And when he inquired: 'Why to-morrow?' did you
reply: 'A night has been known to change the whole
current of one's affairs'?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"Miss Dare, what did you mean by those words?"</p>

<p>"I object!" cried Mr. Orcutt, rising. Unseen by any
save himself, the prisoner had made him an eloquent gesture,
slight, but peremptory.</p>

<p>"I think it is one I have a right to ask," urged the
District Attorney.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>But Mr. Orcutt, who manifestly had the best of the
argument, maintained his objection, and the Court instantly
ruled in his favor.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris prepared to modify his question. But before
he could speak the voice of Miss Dare was heard.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said she, "there was no need of all this
talk. I intended to seek an interview with Mrs. Clemmens
and try what the effect would be of confiding to her
my interest in her nephew."</p>

<p>The dignified simplicity with which she spoke, and the
air of quiet candor that for that one moment surrounded
her, gave to this voluntary explanation an unexpected
force that carried it quite home to the hearts of the jury.
Even Mr. Orcutt could not preserve the frown with which
he had confronted her at the first movement of her lips,
but turned toward the prisoner with a look almost congratulatory
in its character. But Mr. Byrd, who for reasons
of his own kept his eyes upon that prisoner, observed
that it met with no other return than that shadow of a
bitter smile which now and then visited his otherwise unmoved
countenance.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris, who, in his friendship for the witness, was
secretly rejoiced in an explanation which separated her
from the crime of her lover, bowed in acknowledgment of
the answer she had been pleased to give him in face of the
ruling of the Court, and calmly proceeded:</p>

<p>"And what reply did the prisoner make you when you
uttered this remark in reference to the change that a
single day sometimes makes in one's affairs?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p>"Something in the way of assent."</p>

<p>"Cannot you give us his words?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, then, can you tell us whether or not he looked
thoughtful when you said this?"</p>

<p>"He may have done so, sir."</p>

<p>"Did it strike you at the time that he reflected on what
you said?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say how it struck me at the time."</p>

<p>"Did he look at you a few minutes before speaking,
or in any way conduct himself as if he had been set
thinking?"</p>

<p>"He did not speak for a few minutes."</p>

<p>"And looked at you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>The District Attorney paused a moment as if to let the
results of his examination sink into the minds of the jury;
then he went on:</p>

<p>"Miss Dare, you say you returned the ring to the
prisoner?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You say positively the ring passed from you to him;
that you saw it in his hand after it had left yours?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. The ring passed from me to him, but I did
not see it in his hand, because I did not return it to him
that way. I dropped it into his pocket."</p>

<p>At this acknowledgment, which made both the prisoner
and his counsel look up, Mr. Byrd felt himself nudged by
Hickory.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you hear that?" he whispered.</p>

<p>"Yes," returned the other.</p>

<p>"And do you believe it?"</p>

<p>"Miss Dare is on oath," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Pooh!" was Hickory's whispered exclamation.</p>

<p>The District Attorney alone showed no surprise.</p>

<p>"You dropped it into his pocket?" he resumed. "How
came you to do that?"</p>

<p>"I was weary of the strife which had followed my refusal
to accept this token. He would not take it from me himself,
so I restored it to him in the way I have said."</p>

<p>"Miss Dare, will you tell us what pocket this was?"</p>

<p>"The outside pocket on the left side of his coat," she
returned, with a cold and careful exactness that caused the
prisoner to drop his eyes from her face, with that faint
but scornful twitch of the muscles about his mouth, which
gave to his countenance now and then the proud look of
disdain which both the detectives had noted.</p>

<p>"Miss Dare," continued the Prosecuting Attorney, "did
you see this ring again during the interview?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Did you detect the prisoner making any move to take
it out of his pocket, or have you any reason to believe
that it was taken out of the pocket on the left-hand side
of his coat while you were with him?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"So that, as far as you know, it was still in his pocket
when you parted?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Miss Dare, have you ever seen that ring since?"</p>

<p>"I have."</p>

<p>"When and where?"</p>

<p>"I saw it on the morning of the murder. It was lying
on the floor of Mrs. Clemmens' dining-room. I had gone
to the house, in my surprise at hearing of the murderous
assault which had been made upon her, and, while surveying
the spot where she was struck, perceived this ring lying
on the floor before me."</p>

<p>"What made you think it was this ring which you had
returned to the prisoner the day before?"</p>

<p>"Because of its setting, and the character of the gem, I
suppose."</p>

<p>"Could you see all this where it was lying on the
floor?"</p>

<p>"It was brought nearer to my eyes, sir. A gentleman
who was standing near, picked it up and offered it to me,
supposing it was mine. As he held it out in his open palm
I saw it plainly."</p>

<p>"Miss Dare, will you tell us what you did when you
first saw this ring lying on the floor?"</p>

<p>"I covered it with my foot."</p>

<p>"Was that before you recognized it?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say. I placed my foot upon it instinctively."</p>

<p>"How long did you keep it there?"</p>

<p>"Some few minutes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>"What caused you to move at last?"</p>

<p>"I was surprised."</p>

<p>"What surprised you?"</p>

<p>"A man came to the door."</p>

<p>"What man."</p>

<p>"I don't know. A stranger to me. Some one who had
been sent on an errand connected with this affair."</p>

<p>"What did he say or do to surprise you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. It was what you said yourself after the
man had gone."</p>

<p>"And what did I say, Miss Dare?"</p>

<p>She cast him a look of the faintest appeal, but answered
quietly:</p>

<p>"Something about its not being the tramp who had
committed this crime."</p>

<p>"That surprised you?"</p>

<p>"That made me start."</p>

<p>"Miss Dare, were you present in the house when the
dying woman spoke the one or two exclamations which
have been testified to in this trial?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"What was the burden of the first speech you heard?"</p>

<p>"The words <i>Hand</i>, sir, and <i>Ring</i>. She repeated the
two half a dozen times."</p>

<p>"Miss Dare, what did you say to the gentleman who
showed you the ring and asked if it were yours?"</p>

<p>"I told him it was mine, and took it and placed it on
my finger."</p>

<p>"But the ring was not yours?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<p>"My acceptance of it made it mine. In all but that
regard it had been mine ever since Mr. Mansell offered it
to me the day before."</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris surveyed the witness for a moment before
saying:</p>

<p>"Then you considered it damaging to your lover to
have this ring found in that apartment?"</p>

<p>Mr. Orcutt instantly rose to object.</p>

<p>"I won't press the question," said the District Attorney,
with a wave of his hand and a slight look at the jury.</p>

<p>"You ought never to have asked it?" exclaimed Mr.
Orcutt, with the first appearance of heat he had shown.</p>

<p>"You are right," Mr. Ferris coolly responded. "The
jury could see the point without any assistance from you
or me."</p>

<p>"And the jury," returned Mr. Orcutt, with equal coolness,
"is scarcely obliged to you for the suggestion."</p>

<p>"Well, we won't quarrel about it," declared Mr.
Ferris.</p>

<p>"We won't quarrel about any thing," retorted Mr. Orcutt.
"We will try the case in a legal manner."</p>

<p>"Have you got through?" inquired Mr. Ferris, nettled.</p>

<p>Mr. Orcutt took his seat with the simple reply:</p>

<p>"Go on with the case."</p>

<p>The District Attorney, after a momentary pause to regain
the thread of his examination and recover his equanimity,
turned to the witness.</p>

<p>"Miss Dare," he asked, "how long did you keep that
ring on your finger after you left the house?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>"A little while&mdash;five or ten minutes, perhaps."</p>

<p>"Where were you when you took it off?"</p>

<p>Her voice sank just a trifle:</p>

<p>"On the bridge at Warren Street."</p>

<p>"What did you do with it then?"</p>

<p>Her eyes which had been upon the Attorney's face, fell
slowly.</p>

<p>"I dropped it into the water," she said.</p>

<p>And the character of her thoughts and suspicions at
that time stood revealed.</p>

<p>The Prosecuting Attorney allowed himself a few more
questions.</p>

<p>"When you parted with the prisoner in the woods, was
it with any arrangement for meeting again before he returned
to Buffalo?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Give us the final words of your conversation, if you
please."</p>

<p>"We were just parting, and I had turned to go, when
he said: 'Is it good-by, then, Imogene?' and I answered,
'That to-morrow must decide.' 'Shall I stay, then?'
he inquired; to which I replied, 'Yes.'"</p>

<p>'Twas a short, seemingly literal, repetition of possibly
innocent words, but the whisper into which her voice
sank at the final "Yes" endowed it with a thrilling effect
for which even she was not prepared. For she shuddered
as she realized the deathly quiet that followed its utterance,
and cast a quick look at Mr. Orcutt that was full of
question, if not doubt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was calculating upon the interview I intended to
have with Mrs. Clemmens," she explained, turning toward
the Judge with indescribable dignity.</p>

<p>"We understand that," remarked the Prosecuting Attorney,
kindly, and then inquired:</p>

<p>"Was this the last you saw of the prisoner until to-day?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"When did you see him again?"</p>

<p>"On the following Wednesday."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"In the dep&ocirc;t at Syracuse."</p>

<p>"How came you to be in Syracuse the day after the
murder?"</p>

<p>"I had started to go to Buffalo."</p>

<p>"What purpose had you in going to Buffalo?"</p>

<p>"I wished to see Mr. Mansell."</p>

<p>"Did he know you were coming?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Had no communication passed between you from the
time you parted in the woods till you came upon each
other in the dep&ocirc;t you have just mentioned?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Had he no reason to expect to meet you there?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"With what words did you accost each other?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I have no remembrance of saying
any thing. I was utterly dumbfounded at seeing him in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
this place, and cannot say into what exclamation I may
have been betrayed."</p>

<p>"And he? Don't you remember what he said?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. I only know he started back with a look of
great surprise. Afterward he asked if I were on my
way to see him."</p>

<p>"And what did you answer?"</p>

<p>"I don't think I made any answer. I was wondering
if he was on his way to see me."</p>

<p>"Did you put the question to him?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps. I cannot tell. It is all like a dream to
me."</p>

<p>If she had said horrible dream, every one there would
have believed her.</p>

<p>"You can tell us, however, if you held any conversation?"</p>

<p>"We did not."</p>

<p>"And you can tell us how the interview terminated?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I turned away and took the train back
home, which I saw standing on the track without."</p>

<p>"And he?"</p>

<p>"Turned away also. Where he went I cannot say."</p>

<p>"Miss Dare"&mdash;the District Attorney's voice was very
earnest&mdash;"can you tell us which of you made the first
movement to go?"</p>

<p>"What does he mean by that?" whispered Hickory to
Byrd.</p>

<p>"I think&mdash;&mdash;" she commenced and paused. Her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
eyes in wandering over the throng of spectators before
her, had settled on these two detectives, and noting the
breathless way in which they looked at her, she seemed
to realize that more might lie in this question than at
first appeared.</p>

<p>"I do not know," she answered at last. "It was a
simultaneous movement, I think."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" persisted Mr. Ferris. "You are on
oath, Miss Dare? Is there no way in which you can
make certain whether he or you took the initiatory step
in this sudden parting after an event that so materially
changed your mutual prospects?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. I can only say that in recalling the sensations
of that hour, I am certain my own movement was
not the result of any I saw him take. The instinct to
leave the place had its birth in my own breast."</p>

<p>"I told you so," commented Hickory, in the ear of
Byrd. "She is not going to give herself away, whatever
happens."</p>

<p>"But can you positively say he did not make the first
motion to leave?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris bowed, turned toward the opposing counsel
and said:</p>

<p>"The witness is yours."</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris sat down perfectly satisfied. He had dexterously
brought out Imogene's suspicions of the prisoner's
guilt, and knew that the jury must be influenced in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
their convictions by those of the woman who, of all the
world, ought to have believed, if she could, in the innocence
of her lover. He did not even fear the cross-examination
which he expected to follow. No amount
of skill on the part of Orcutt could extract other than the
truth, and the truth was that Imogene believed the
prisoner to be the murderer of his aunt. He, therefore,
surveyed the court-room with a smile, and awaited the
somewhat slow proceedings of his opponent with equanimity.</p>

<p>But, to the surprise of every one, Mr. Orcutt, after a
short consultation with the prisoner, rose and said he had
no questions to put to the witness.</p>

<p>And Miss Dare was allowed to withdraw from the
stand, to the great satisfaction of Mr. Ferris, who found
himself by this move in a still better position than he had
anticipated.</p>

<p>"Byrd," whispered Hickory, as Miss Dare returned
somewhat tremulously to her former seat among the
witnesses&mdash;"Byrd, you could knock me over with a
feather. I thought the defence would have no difficulty
in riddling this woman's testimony, and they have not
even made the effort. Can it be that Orcutt has such
an attachment for her that he is going to let his rival
hang?"</p>

<p>"No. Orcutt isn't the man to deliberately lose a case
for any woman. He looks at Miss Dare's testimony from
a different standpoint than you do. He believes what
she says to be true, and you do not."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then, all I've got to say, 'So much the worse for
Mansell!'" was the whispered response. "He was a
fool to trust his case to that man."</p>

<p>The judge, the jury, and all the by-standers in court, it
must be confessed, shared the opinion of Hickory&mdash;Mr.
Orcutt was standing on slippery ground.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>
<h2>XXIX.</h2>

<h3>THE OPENING OF THE DEFENCE.</h3>

<div class='center'>
Excellent! I smell a device.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Twelfth Night.</span><br />
<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>LATE that afternoon the prosecution rested. It had
made out a case of great strength and seeming
impregnability. Favorably as every one was disposed to
regard the prisoner, the evidence against him was such
that, to quote a man who was pretty free with his opinions
in the lobby of the court-room: "Orcutt will have to
wake up if he is going to clear his man in face of facts
like these."</div>

<p>The moment, therefore, when this famous lawyer and
distinguished advocate rose to open the defence, was one
of great interest to more than the immediate actors in the
scene. It was felt that hitherto he had rather idled with
his case, and curiosity was awake to his future course.
Indeed, in the minds of many the counsel for the prisoner
was on trial as well as his client.</p>

<p>He rose with more of self-possession, quiet and reserved
strength, than could be hoped for, and his look
toward the Court and then to the jury tended to gain for
him the confidence which up to this moment he seemed
to be losing. Never a handsome man or even an imposing
one, he had the advantage of always rising to the occasion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
and whether pleading with a jury or arguing with
opposing counsel, flashed with that unmistakable glitter
of keen and ready intellect which, once observed in a
man, marks him off from his less gifted fellows and makes
him the cynosure of all eyes, however insignificant his
height, features, or ordinary expression.</p>

<p>To-day he was even cooler, more brilliant, and more
confident in his bearing than usual. Feelings, if feelings
he possessed&mdash;and we who have seen him at his hearth
can have no doubt on this subject,&mdash;had been set aside
when he rose to his feet and turned his face upon the
expectant crowd before him. To save his client seemed the
one predominating impulse of his soul, and, as he drew
himself up to speak, Mr. Byrd, who was watching him with
the utmost eagerness and anticipation, felt that, despite
appearances, despite evidence, despite probability itself,
this man was going to win his case.</p>

<p>"May it please your Honor and Gentlemen of the Jury,"
he began, and those who looked at him could not but
notice how the prisoner at his side lifted his head at this
address, till it seemed as if the words issued from his lips
instead of from those of his counsel, "I stand before you
to-day not to argue with my learned opponent in reference
to the evidence which he has brought out with so much
ingenuity. I have a simpler duty than that to perform.
I have to show you how, in spite of this evidence, in face
of all this accumulated testimony showing the prisoner to
have been in possession of both motive and opportunities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
for committing this crime, he is guiltless of it; that a
physical impossibility stands in the way of his being the
assailant of the Widow Clemmens, and that to whomever
or whatsoever her death may be due, it neither was nor
could have been the result of any blow struck by the
prisoner's hand. In other words, we dispute, not the
facts which have led the Prosecuting Attorney of this
district, and perhaps others also, to infer guilt on the
part of the prisoner,"&mdash;here Mr. Orcutt cast a significant
glance at the bench where the witnesses sat,&mdash;"but the
inference itself. Something besides proof of motive and
opportunity must be urged against <i>this</i> man in order to
convict him of guilt. Nor is it sufficient to show he was
on the scene of murder some time during the fatal morning
when Mrs. Clemmens was attacked; you must prove
he was there at the time the deadly blow was struck; for
it is not with him as with so many against whom circumstantial
evidence of guilt is brought. <i>This</i> man, gentlemen,
has an answer for those who accuse him of crime&mdash;an
answer, too, before which all the circumstantial evidence
in the world cannot stand. Do you want to know
what it is? Give me but a moment's attention and you
shall hear."</p>

<p>Expectation, which had been rising through this exordium,
now stood at fever-point. Byrd and Hickory
held their breaths, and even Miss Dare showed feeling
through the icy restraint which had hitherto governed
her secret anguish and suspense. Mr. Orcutt went on:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p>"First, however, as I have already said, the prisoner
desires it to be understood that he has no intention of
disputing the various facts which have been presented before
you at this trial. He does not deny that he was in
great need of money at the time of his aunt's death; that
he came to Sibley to entreat her to advance to him certain
sums he deemed necessary to the furtherance of his
plans; that he came secretly and in the roundabout way
you describe. Neither does he refuse to allow that his
errand was also one of love, that he sought and obtained
a private interview with the woman he wished to make his
wife, in the place and at the time testified to; that the
scraps of conversation which have been sworn to as having
passed between them at this interview are true in as
far as they go, and that he did place upon the finger of
Miss Dare a diamond ring. Also, he admits that she took
this ring off immediately upon receiving it, saying she
could not accept it, at least not then, and that she entreated
him to take it back, which he declined to do,
though he cannot say she did not restore it in the manner
she declares, for he remembers nothing of the ring after
the moment he put her hand aside as she was offering it
back to him. The prisoner also allows that he slept in
the hut and remained in that especial region of the woods
until near noon the next day; but, your Honor and Gentlemen
of the Jury, what the prisoner does not allow and
will not admit is that he struck the blow which eventually
robbed Mrs. Clemmens of her life, and the proof which I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
propose to bring forward in support of this assertion is
this:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Clemmens received the blow which led to her
death at some time previously to three minutes past
twelve o'clock on Tuesday, September 26th. This the
prosecution has already proved. Now, what I propose to
show is, that Mrs. Clemmens, however or whenever assailed,
was still living and unhurt up to ten minutes before
twelve on that same day. A witness, whom you
must believe, saw her at that time and conversed with
her, proving that the blow by which she came to her death
must have occurred after that hour, that is, after ten minutes
before noon. But, your Honor and Gentlemen of the
Jury, the prosecution has already shown that the prisoner
stepped on to the train at Monteith Quarry Station at
twenty minutes past one of that same day, and has produced
witnesses whose testimony positively proves that
the road he took there from Mrs. Clemmens' house was
the same he had traversed in his secret approach to it
the day before&mdash;viz., the path through the woods; the
only path, I may here state, that connects those two
points with any thing like directness.</p>

<p>"But, Sirs, what the prosecution has not shown you,
and what it now devolves upon me to show, is that this
path which the prisoner is allowed to have taken is one
which no man could traverse without encountering great
difficulties and many hindrances to speed. It is not
only a narrow path filled with various encumbrances in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
the way of brambles and rolling stones, but it is so
flanked by an impenetrable undergrowth in some places,
and by low, swampy ground in others, that no deviation
from its course is possible, while to keep within it and
follow its many turns and windings till it finally emerges
upon the highway that leads to the Quarry Station would
require many more minutes than those which elapsed
between the time of the murder and the hour the prisoner
made his appearance at the Quarry Station. In other
words, I propose to introduce before you as witnesses two
gentlemen from New York, both of whom are experts in
all feats of pedestrianism, and who, having been over the
road themselves, are in position to testify that the time
necessary for a man to pass by means of this path from
Mrs. Clemmens' house to the Quarry Station is, by a
definite number of minutes, greater than that allowed to
the prisoner by the evidence laid before you. If, therefore,
you accept the testimony of the prosecution as
true, and believe that the prisoner took the train for
Buffalo, which he has been said to do, it follows, as a
physical impossibility, for him to have been at Mrs.
Clemmens' cottage, or anywhere else except on the road to
the station, at the moment when the fatal blow was dealt.</p>

<p>"Your Honor, this is our answer to the terrible charge
which has been made against the prisoner; it is simple,
but it is effective, and upon it, as upon a rock, we found
our defence."</p>

<p>And with a bow, Mr. Orcutt sat down, and, it being
late in the day, the court adjourned.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>
<h2>XXX.</h2>

<h3>BYRD USES HIS PENCIL AGAIN.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Ay, sir, you shall find me reasonable; if it be so, I shall do that that is
reason.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Merry Wives of Windsor.</span></p><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>"BYRD, you look dazed."</div>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>Hickory paused till they were well clear of the crowd
that was pouring from the court-room; then he said:</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think of this as a defence?"</p>

<p>"I am beginning to think it is good," was the slow,
almost hesitating, reply.</p>

<p>"Beginning to think?"</p>

<p>"Yes. At first it seemed puerile. I had such a steadfast
belief in Mansell's guilt, I could not give much credit
to any argument tending to shake me loose from my convictions.
But the longer I think of it the more vividly I
remember the difficulties of the road he had to take in
his flight. I have travelled it myself, you remember, and
I don't see how he could have got over the ground in
ninety minutes."</p>

<p>Hickory's face assumed a somewhat quizzical expression.</p>

<p>"Byrd," said he, "whom were you looking at during
the time Mr. Orcutt was making his speech?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>"At the speaker, of course."</p>

<p>"Bah!"</p>

<p>"Whom were <i>you</i> looking at?"</p>

<p>"At the person who would be likely to give me some
return for my pains."</p>

<p>"The prisoner?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Whom, then?"</p>

<p>"Miss Dare."</p>

<p>Byrd shifted uneasily to the other side of his companion.</p>

<p>"And what did you discover from her, Hickory?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Two things. First, that she knew no more than the
rest of us what the defence was going to be. Secondly,
that she regarded it as a piece of great cleverness on the
part of Orcutt, but that she didn't believe in it anymore&mdash;well,
any more than I do."</p>

<p>"Hickory!"</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>sir!</i> Miss Dare is a smart woman, and a resolute
one, and could have baffled the penetration of all
concerned if she had only remembered to try. But she
forgot that others might be more interested in making
out what was going on in her mind at this critical moment
than in watching the speaker or noting the effect of
his words upon the court. In fact, she was too eager herself
to hear what he had to say to remember her <i>r&ocirc;le</i>, I
fancy."</p>

<p>"But, I don't see&mdash;&mdash;" began Byrd.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wait," interrupted the other. "You believe Miss
Dare loves Craik Mansell?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly," was the gloomy response.</p>

<p>"Very well, then. If she had known what the defence
was going to be she would have been acutely alive
to the effect it was going to have upon the jury. That
would have been her first thought and her only thought
all the time Mr. Orcutt was speaking, and she would have
sat with her eyes fixed upon the men upon whose acceptance
or non-acceptance of the truth of this argument her
lover's life ultimately depended. But no; her gaze, like
yours, remained fixed upon Mr. Orcutt, and she scarcely
breathed or stirred till he had fully revealed what his
argument was going to be. Then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, then?"</p>

<p>"Instead of flashing with the joy of relief which any
devoted woman would experience who sees in this argument
a proof of her lover's innocence, she merely dropped
her eyes and resumed her old mask of impassiveness."</p>

<p>"From all of which you gather&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That her feelings were not those of relief, but doubt.
In other words, that the knowledge she possesses is of a
character which laughs to scorn any such subterfuge of
defence as Orcutt advances."</p>

<p>"Hickory," ventured Byrd, after a long silence, "it is
time we understood each other. What is your secret
thought in relation to Miss Dare?"</p>

<p>"My secret thought? Well," drawled the other, looking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
away, "I think she knows more about this crime than
she has yet chosen to reveal."</p>

<p>"More than she evinced to-day in her testimony?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I should like to know why you think so. What
special reasons have you for drawing any such conclusions?"</p>

<p>"Well, one reason is, that she was no more shaken by
the plausible argument advanced by Mr. Orcutt. If her
knowledge of the crime was limited to what she acknowledged
in her testimony, and her conclusions as to Mansell's
guilt were really founded upon such facts as she
gave us in court to-day, why didn't she grasp at the possibility
of her lover's innocence which was held out to her
by his counsel? No facts that she had testified to, not
even the fact of his ring having been found on the scene
of murder, could stand before the proof that he left the
region of Mrs. Clemmens' house before the moment of
assault; yet, while evincing interest in the argument, and
some confidence in it, too, as one that would be likely to
satisfy the jury, she gave no tokens of being surprised by
it into a reconsideration of her own conclusions, as must
have happened if she told the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, when she was on the stand to-day."</p>

<p>"I see," remarked Byrd, "that you are presuming to
understand Miss Dare after all."</p>

<p>Hickory smiled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>

<p>"You call this woman a mystery," proceeded Byrd;
"hint at great possibilities of acting on her part, and yet
in a moment, as it were, profess yourself the reader of her
inmost thoughts, and the interpreter of looks and expressions
she has manifestly assumed to hide those
thoughts."</p>

<p>Hickory's smile broadened into a laugh.</p>

<p>"Just so," he cried. "One's imbecility has to stop
somewhere." Then, as he saw Byrd look grave, added:
"I haven't a single fact at my command that isn't
shared by you. My conclusions are different, that is all."</p>

<p>Horace Byrd did not answer. Perhaps if Hickory
could have sounded his thoughts he would have discovered
that their conclusions were not so far apart as he
imagined.</p>

<p>"Hickory," Byrd at last demanded, "what do you propose
to do with your conclusions?"</p>

<p>"I propose to wait and see if Mr. Orcutt proves his
case. If he don't, I have nothing more to say; but if he
does, I think I shall call the attention of Mr. Ferris to
one question he has omitted to ask Miss Dare."</p>

<p>"And what is that?"</p>

<p>"Where she was on the morning of Mrs. Clemmens'
murder. You remember you took some interest in that
question yourself a while ago."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not that I think any thing will come of it, only my
conscience will be set at rest."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hickory,"&mdash;Byrd's face had quite altered now&mdash;"where
do you think Miss Dare was at that time?"</p>

<p>"Where do I think she was?" repeated Hickory.</p>

<p>"Well, I will tell you. I think she was <i>not</i> in Professor
Darling's observatory."</p>

<p>"Do you think she was in the glade back of Widow
Clemmens' house?"</p>

<p>"Now you ask me conundrums."</p>

<p>"Hickory!" Byrd spoke almost violently, "Mr.
Orcutt shall not prove his case."</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>"I will make the run over the ground supposed to
have been taken by Mansell in his flight, and show in
my own proper person that it can be done in the time
specified."</p>

<p>Hickory's eye, which had taken a rapid survey of his
companion's form during the utterance of the above,
darkened, then he slowly shook his head.</p>

<p>"You couldn't," he rejoined laconically. "Too little
staying power; you'd give out before you got clear of
the woods. Better delegate the job to me."</p>

<p>"To you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I'm of the make to stand long runs; besides I
am no novice at athletic sports of any kind. More than
one race has owed its interest to the efforts of your humble
servant. 'Tis my pet amusement, you see, as off-hand
drawing is yours, and is likely to be of as much use to
me, eh?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hickory, you are chaffing me."</p>

<p>"Think so? Do you see that five-barred gate over
there? Well, now keep your eye on the top rail and see
if I clear it without a graze or not."</p>

<p>"Stop!" exclaimed Mr. Byrd, "don't make a fool of
yourself in the public street. I'll believe you if you say
you understand such things."</p>

<p>"Well, I do, and what is more, I'm an adept at them.
If I can't make that run in the time requisite to show that
Mansell could have committed the murder, and yet arrive
at the station the moment he did, I don't know of a
chap who can."</p>

<p>"Hickory, do you mean to say you <i>will</i> make this
run?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"With a conscientious effort to prove that Orcutt's
scheme of defence is false?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow."</p>

<p>"While we are in court?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Byrd turned square around, gave Hickory a look and
offered his hand.</p>

<p>"You are a good fellow," he declared, "May luck go
with you."</p>

<p>Hickory suddenly became unusually thoughtful.</p>

<p>"A little while ago," he reflected, "this fellow's sympathies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
were all with Mansell; now he would risk my limbs
and neck to have the man proved guilty. He does not
wish Miss Dare to be questioned again, I see."</p>

<p>"Hickory," resumed Byrd, a few minutes later, "Orcutt
has not rested the defence upon this one point without
being very sure of its being unassailable."</p>

<p>"I know that."</p>

<p>"He has had more than one expert make that run during
the weeks that have elapsed since the murder. It has
been tested to the uttermost."</p>

<p>"I know <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>"If you succeed then in doing what none of these
others have, it must be by dint of a better understanding
of the route you have to take and the difficulties you will
have to overcome. Now, do you understand the route?"</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"You will have to start from the widow's door, you
know?"</p>

<p>"Certain."</p>

<p>"Cross the bog, enter the woods, skirt the hut&mdash;but I
won't go into details. The best way to prove you know
exactly what you have to do is to see if you can describe
the route yourself. Come into my room, old fellow, and
let us see if you can give me a sufficiently exact account
of the ground you will have to pass over, for me to draw
up a chart by it. An hour spent with paper and pencil
to-night may save you from an uncertainty to-morrow
that would lose you a good ten minutes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<span class="right">(Page 364)</span>
</div>

<p>"Good! that's an idea; let's try it," rejoined Hickory.</p>

<p>And being by this time at the hotel, they went in. In
another moment they were shut up in Mr. Byrd's room,
with a large sheet of foolscap before them.</p>

<p>"Now," cried Horace, taking up a pencil, "begin with
your description, and I will follow with my drawing."</p>

<p>"Very well," replied Hickory, setting himself forward
in a way to watch his colleague's pencil. "I leave the
widow's house by the dining-room door&mdash;a square for the
house, Byrd, well down in the left-hand corner of the
paper, and a dotted line for the path I take,&mdash;run down
the yard to the fence, leap it, cross the bog, and make
straight for the woods."</p>

<p>"Very good," commented Byrd, sketching rapidly as
the other spoke.</p>

<p>"Having taken care to enter where the trees are thinnest,
I find a path along which I rush in a bee-line till I
come to the glade&mdash;an ellipse for the glade, Byrd, with a
dot in it for the hut. Merely stopping to dash into the
hut and out again&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait!" put in Byrd, pausing with his pencil in mid-air;
"what did you want to go into the hut for?"</p>

<p>"To get the bag which I propose to leave there to-night."</p>

<p>"Bag?"</p>


<p>"Yes; Mansell carried a bag, didn't he? Don't you
remember what the station-master said about the curious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
portmanteau the fellow had in his hand when he came to
the station?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Byrd, if I run that fellow to his death it must be
fairly. A man with an awkward bag in his hand cannot
run like a man without one. So I handicap myself in the
same way he did, do you see?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Very well, then; I rush into the hut, pick up the bag,
carry it out, and dash immediately into the woods at the
opening behind the hut.&mdash;What are you doing?"</p>

<p>"Just putting in a few landmarks," explained Byrd,
who had run his pencil off in an opposite direction.
"See, that is the path to West Side which I followed in
my first expedition through the woods&mdash;the path, too,
which Miss Dare took when she came to the hut at the
time of the fearful thunderstorm. And wait, let me put
in Professor Darling's house, too, and the ridge from
which you can see Mrs. Clemmens' cottage. It will help
us to understand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" cried Hickory, with quick suspiciousness, as
the other paused.</p>

<p>But Byrd, impatiently shaking his head, answered:</p>

<p>"The whole situation, of course." Then, pointing
hastily back to the hut, exclaimed: "So you have entered
the woods again at this place? Very well; what then?"</p>

<p>"Well, then," resumed Hickory, "I make my way
along the path I find there&mdash;run it at right angles to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
one leading up to the glade&mdash;till I come to a stony ledge
covered with blackberry bushes. (A very cleverly drawn
blackberry patch that, Byrd.) Here I fear I shall have to
pause."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because, deuce take me if I can remember where the
path runs after that."</p>

<p>"But I can. A big hemlock-tree stands just at the
point where the woods open again. Make for that and
you will be all right."</p>

<p>"Good enough; but it's mighty rough travelling over
that ledge, and I shall have to go at a foot's pace. The
stones are slippery as glass, and a fall would scarcely be
conducive to the final success of my scheme."</p>

<p>"I will make the path serpentine."</p>

<p>"That will be highly expressive."</p>

<p>"And now, what next?"</p>

<p>"The Foresters' Road, Byrd, upon which I ought to
come about this time. Run it due east and west&mdash;not
that I have surveyed the ground, but it looks more
natural so&mdash;and let the dotted line traverse it toward the
right, for that is the direction in which I shall go."</p>

<p>"It's done," said Byrd.</p>

<p>"Well, description fails me now. All I know is, I
come out on a hillside running straight down to the
river-bank and that the highway is visible beyond,
leading directly to the station; but the way to get to
it&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will show you," interposed Byrd, mapping out the
station and the intervening river with a few quick strokes
of his dexterous pencil. "You see this point where you
issue from the woods? Very good; it is, as you say, on
a hillside overlooking the river. Well, it seems unfortunate,
but there is no way of crossing that river at this
point. The falls above and below make it no place for
boats, and you will have to go back along its banks for
some little distance before you come to a bridge. But
there is no use in hesitating or looking about for a
shorter path. The woods just here are encumbered with
a mass of tangled undergrowth which make them simply
impassable except as you keep in the road, while the
river curves so frequently and with so much abruptness&mdash;see,
I will endeavor to give you some notion of it here&mdash;that
you would only waste time in attempting to make
any short cuts. But, once over the bridge&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have only to foot it," burst in Hickory, taking up
the sketch which the other had now completed, and
glancing at it with a dubious eye. "Do you know,
Byrd," he remarked in another moment, "that it strikes
me Mansell did not take this roundabout road to the
station?"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because it <i>is</i> so roundabout, and he is such a clearheaded
fellow. Couldn't he have got there by some
shorter cut?"</p>

<p>"No. Don't you remember how Orcutt cross-examined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
the station-master about the appearance which
Mansell presented when he came upon the platform,
and how that person was forced to acknowledge that,
although the prisoner looked heated and exhausted, his
clothes were neither muddied nor torn? Now, I did not
think of it at the time, but this was done by Orcutt to
prove that Mansell did take the road I have jotted down
here, since any other would have carried him through
swamps knee-deep with mud, or amongst stones and
briers which would have put him in a state of disorder
totally unfitting him for travel."</p>

<p>"That is so," acquiesced Hickory, after a moment's
thought. "Mansell must be kept in the path. Well,
well, we will see to-morrow if wit and a swift foot can
make any thing out of this problem."</p>

<p>"Wit? Hickory, it <i>will</i> be wit and not a swift foot.
Or luck, maybe I should call it, or rather providence.
If a wagon should be going along the highway,
now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let me alone for availing myself of it," laughed
Hickory. "Wagon! I would jump on the back of a
mule sooner than lose the chance of gaining a minute on
these experts whose testimony we are to hear to-morrow.
Don't lose confidence in old Hickory yet. He's the boy
for this job if he isn't for any other."</p>

<p>And so the matter was settled.</p>

<h2>XXXI.</h2>

<h3>THE CHIEF WITNESS FOR THE DEFENCE.</h3>

<div class='center'>
Your <i>If</i> is the only peace-maker; much virtue in <i>If</i>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">As You Like It.</span><br />
<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>THE crowd that congregated at the court-house the
next morning was even greater than at any previous
time. The opening speech of Mr. Orcutt had been
telegraphed all over the country, and many who had not
been specially interested in the case before felt an anxiety
to hear how he would substantiate the defence he had
so boldly and confidently put forth.</div>

<p>To the general eye, however, the appearance of the
court-room was much the same as on the previous day.
Only to the close observer was it evident that the countenances
of the several actors in this exciting drama wore a
different expression. Mr. Byrd, who by dint of the most
energetic effort had succeeded in procuring his old seat,
was one of these, and as he noted the significant change,
wished that Hickory had been at his side to note it with
him.</p>

<p>The first person he observed was, naturally, the Judge.</p>

<p>Judge Evans, who has been but barely introduced to
the reader, was a man of great moral force and discretion.
He had occupied his present position for many years, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
possessed not only the confidence but the affections of
those who came within the sphere of his jurisdiction.
The reason for this undoubtedly lay in his sympathetic
nature. While never accused of weakness, he so unmistakably
retained the feeling heart under the official ermine
that it was by no means an uncommon thing for him
to show more emotion in uttering a sentence than the
man he condemned did in listening to it.</p>

<p>His expression, then, upon this momentous morning
was of great significance to Mr. Byrd. In its hopefulness
and cheer was written the extent of the effect made upon
the unprejudiced mind by the promised defence.</p>

<p>As for Mr. Orcutt himself, no advocate could display a
more confident air or prepare to introduce his witnesses
with more dignity or quiet assurance. His self-possession
was so marked, indeed, that Mr. Byrd, who felt a sympathetic
interest in what he knew to be seething in this
man's breast, was greatly surprised, and surveyed, with a
feeling almost akin to awe, the lawyer who could so sink
all personal considerations in the cause he was trying.</p>

<p>Miss Dare, on the contrary, was in a state of nervous
agitation. Though no movement betrayed this, the very
force of the restraint she put upon herself showed the
extent of her inner excitement.</p>

<p>The prisoner alone remained unchanged. Nothing
could shake his steady soul from its composure, not the
possibility of death or the prospect of release. He was
absolutely imposing in his quiet presence, and Mr. Byrd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
could not but admire the power of the man even while
recoiling from his supposed guilt.</p>

<p>The opening of the defence carried the minds of many
back to the inquest. The nice question of time was gone
into, and the moment when Mrs. Clemmens was found
lying bleeding and insensible at the foot of her dining-room
clock, fixed at three or four minutes past noon.
The next point to be ascertained was when she received
the deadly blow.</p>

<p>And here the great surprise of the defence occurred.
Mr. Orcutt rose, and in clear, firm tones said:</p>

<p>"Gouverneur Hildreth, take the stand."</p>

<p>Instantly, and before the witness could comply, Mr.
Ferris was on his feet.</p>

<p>"Who? what?" he cried.</p>

<p>"Gouverneur Hildreth," repeated Mr. Orcutt.</p>

<p>"Did you know this gentleman has already been in
custody upon suspicion of having committed the crime
for which the prisoner is now being tried?"</p>

<p>"I do," returned Mr. Orcutt, with imperturbable <i>sang
froid</i>.</p>

<p>"And is it your intention to save your client from the
gallows by putting the halter around the neck of the man
you now propose to call as a witness?"</p>

<p>"No," retorted Mr. Orcutt; "<i>I</i> do not propose to put
the halter about any man's neck. That is the proud
privilege of my learned and respected opponent."</p>

<p>With an impatient frown Mr. Ferris sat down, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
Mr. Hildreth, who had taken advantage of this short passage
of arms between the lawyers to retain his place in
the remote corner where he was more or less shielded
from the curiosity of the crowd, rose, and, with a slow
and painful movement that at once attracted attention to
his carefully bandaged throat and the general air of
debility which surrounded him, came hesitatingly forward
and took his stand in face of the judge and jury.</p>

<p>Necessarily a low murmur greeted him from the throng
of interested spectators who saw in this appearance before
them of the man who, by no more than a hair's-breadth,
had escaped occupying the position of the
prisoner, another of those dramatic incidents with which
this trial seemed fairly to bristle.</p>

<p>It was hushed by one look from the Judge, but not
before it had awakened in Mr. Hildreth's weak and
sensitive nature those old emotions of shame and rage
whose token was a flush so deep and profuse it unconsciously
repelled the gaze of all who beheld it. Immediately
Mr. Byrd, who sat with bated breath, as it were, so
intense was his excitement over the unexpected turn of
affairs, recognized the full meaning of the situation, and
awarded to Mr. Orcutt all the admiration which his
skill in bringing it about undoubtedly deserved. Indeed,
as the detective's quick glance flashed first at the
witness, cringing in his old unfortunate way before the
gaze of the crowd, and then at the prisoner sitting unmoved
and quietly disdainful in his dignity and pride,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
he felt that, whether Mr. Orcutt succeeded in getting
all he wished from his witness, the mere conjunction of
these two men before the jury, with the opportunity
for comparison between them which it inevitably offered,
was the master-stroke of this eminent lawyer's legal
career.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris seemed to feel the significance of the
moment also, for his eyes fell and his brow contracted
with a sudden doubt that convinced Mr. Byrd that,
mentally, he was on the point of giving up his case.</p>

<p>The witness was at once sworn.</p>

<p>"Orcutt believes Hildreth to be the murderer, or, at
least, is willing that others should be impressed with this
belief," was the comment of Byrd to himself at this
juncture.</p>

<p>He had surprised a look which had passed between
the lawyer and Miss Dare&mdash;a look of such piercing
sarcasm and scornful inquiry that it might well arrest the
detective's attention and lead him to question the intentions
of the man who could allow such an expression
of his feelings to escape him.</p>

<p>But whether the detective was correct in his inferences,
or whether Mr. Orcutt's glance at Imogene meant no
more than the natural emotion of a man who suddenly
sees revealed to the woman he loves the face of him for
whose welfare she has expressed the greatest concern and
for whose sake, while unknown, she has consented to
make the heaviest of sacrifices, the wary lawyer was careful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
to show neither scorn nor prejudice when he turned
toward the witness and began his interrogations.</p>

<p>On the contrary, his manner was highly respectful, if
not considerate, and his questions while put with such
art as to keep the jury constantly alert to the anomalous
position which the witness undoubtedly held, were of a
nature mainly to call forth the one fact for which his
testimony was presumably desired. This was, his presence
in the widow's house on the morning of the murder,
and the fact that he saw her and conversed with her and
could swear to her being alive and unhurt up to a few
minutes before noon. To be sure, the precise minute of
his leaving her in this condition Mr. Orcutt failed to
gather from the witness, but, like the coroner at the inquest,
he succeeded in eliciting enough to show that the
visit had been completed prior to the appearance of the
tramp at the widow's kitchen-door, as it had been begun
after the disappearance of the Danton children from the
front of the widow's house.</p>

<p>This fact being established and impressed upon the
jury, Mr. Orcutt with admirable judgment cut short his
own examination of the witness, and passed him over to
the District Attorney, with a grim smile, suggestive of his
late taunt, that to this gentleman belonged the special
privilege of weaving halters for the necks of unhappy
criminals.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris who understood his adversary's tactics only
too well, but who in his anxiety for the truth could not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
afford to let such an opportunity for reaching it slip by,
opened his cross-examination with great vigor.</p>

<p>The result could not but be favorable to the defence
and damaging to the prosecution. The position which
Mr. Hildreth must occupy if the prisoner was acquitted,
was patent to all understandings, making each and every
admission on his part tending to exculpate the latter, of
a manifest force and significance.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris, however, was careful not to exceed his duty
or press his inquiries beyond due bounds. The man
they were trying was not Gouverneur Hildreth but Craik
Mansell, and to press the witness too close, was to urge
him into admissions seemingly so damaging to himself as,
in the present state of affairs, to incur the risk of distracting
attention entirely from the prisoner.</p>

<p>Mr. Hildreth's examination being at an end, Mr.
Orcutt proceeded with his case, by furnishing proof calculated
to fix the moment at which Mr. Hildreth had
made his call. This was done in much the same way as
it was at the inquest. Mrs. Clemmens' next-door neighbor,
Mrs. Danton, was summoned to the stand, and after
her her two children, the testimony of the three, taken
with Mr. Hildreth's own acknowledgments, making it
very evident to all who listened that he could not have
gone into Mrs. Clemmens' house before a quarter to
twelve.</p>

<p>The natural inference followed. Allowing the least
possible time for his interview with Mrs. Clemmens, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
moment at which the witness swore to having seen her
alive and unhurt must have been as late as ten minutes
before noon.</p>

<p>Taking pains to impress this time upon the jury, Mr.
Orcutt next proceeded to fix the moment at which the
prisoner arrived at Monteith Quarry Station. As the
fact of his having arrived in time to take the afternoon
train to Buffalo had been already proved by the prosecution,
it was manifestly necessary only to determine at
what hour the train was due, and whether it had come in
on time.</p>

<p>The hour was ascertained, by direct consultation with
the road's time-table, to be just twenty minutes past one,
and the station-master having been called to the stand,
gave it as his best knowledge and belief that the train had
been on time.</p>

<p>This, however, not being deemed explicit enough for
the purposes of the defence, there was submitted to the
jury a telegram bearing the date of that same day, and
distinctly stating that the train was on time. This was
testified to by the conductor of the train as having been
sent by him to the superintendent of the road who was
awaiting the cars at Monteith; and was received as evidence
and considered as conclusively fixing the hour at
which the prisoner arrived at the Quarry Station as
twenty minutes past one.</p>

<p>This settled, witnesses were called to testify as to the
nature of the path by which he must have travelled from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
the widow's house to the station. A chart similar to that
Mr. Byrd had drawn, but more explicit and nice in its
details, was submitted to the jury by an actual surveyor
of the ground; after which, and the establishment of
other minor details not necessary to enumerate here, a
man of well-known proficiency in running and other
athletic sports, was summoned to the stand.</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd, who up to this moment had shared in the
interest every where displayed in the defence, now felt
his attention wandering. The fact is, he had heard the
whistle of the train on which Hickory had promised to
return to Sibley, and interesting as was the testimony
given by the witness, he could not prevent his eyes from
continually turning toward the door by which he expected
Hickory to enter.</p>

<p>Strange to say, Mr. Orcutt seemed to take a like interest
in that same door, and was more than once detected
by Byrd flashing a hurried glance in its direction, as if he,
too, were on the look-out for some one.</p>

<p>Meantime the expert in running was saying:</p>

<p>"It took me one hundred and twenty minutes to go
over the ground the first time, and one hundred and
fifteen minutes the next. I gained five minutes the second
time, you see," he explained, "by knowing my ground
better and by saving my strength where it was of no avail
to attempt great speed. The last time I made the effort,
however, I lost three minutes on my former time. The
wood road which I had to take for some distance was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
deep with mud, and my feet sank with every step. The
shortest time, then, which I was able to make in three
attempts, was one hundred and fifteen minutes."</p>

<p>Now, as the time between the striking of the fatal blow
and the hour at which the prisoner arrived at the Quarry
Station was only ninety minutes, a general murmur of
satisfaction followed this announcement. It was only
momentary, however, for Mr. Ferris, rising to cross-examine
the witness, curiosity prevailed over all lesser emotions,
and an immediate silence followed without the
intervention of the Court.</p>

<p>"Did you make these three runs from Mrs. Clemmens'
house to Monteith Quarry Station entirely on foot?"</p>

<p>"I did, sir."</p>

<p>"Was that necessary?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; as far as the highway, at least. The path
through the woods is not wide enough for a horse, unless
it be for that short distance where the Foresters' Road
intervenes."</p>

<p>"And you ran there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, twice at full speed; the third time I had the
experience I have told you of."</p>

<p>"And how long do you think it took you to go over
that especial portion of ground?"</p>

<p>"Five minutes, maybe."</p>

<p>"And, supposing you had had a horse?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, <i>if</i> I had had a horse, and <i>if</i> he had been
waiting there, all ready for me to jump on his back, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
<i>if</i> he had been a good runner and used to the road, I
think I could have gone over it in two minutes, if I had
not first broken my neck on some of the jagged stones
that roughen the road."</p>

<p>"In other words, you could have saved three minutes
if you had been furnished with a horse at that particular
spot?"</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>if</i>."</p>

<p>Mr. Orcutt, whose eye had been fixed upon the door at
this particular juncture, now looked back at the witness
and hurriedly rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"Has my esteemed friend any testimony on hand to
prove that the prisoner had a horse at this place? if he
has not, I object to these questions."</p>

<p>"What testimony I have to produce will come in at its
proper time," retorted Mr. Ferris. "Meanwhile, I think
I have a right to put this or any other kind of similar
question to the witness."</p>

<p>The Judge acquiescing with a nod, Mr. Orcutt sat
down.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris went on.</p>

<p>"Did you meet any one on the road during any of
these three runs which you made?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. That is, I met no one in the woods. There
were one or two persons on the highway the last time I
ran over it."</p>

<p>"Were they riding or walking?"</p>

<p>"Walking."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span></p>

<p>Here Mr. Orcutt interposed.</p>

<p>"Did you say that in passing over the highway you
ran?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Why did you do this? Had you not been told that
the prisoner was seen to be walking when he came down
the road to the station?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. But I was in for time, you see."</p>

<p>"And you did not make it even with that advantage?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>The second expert had the same story to tell, with a
few variations. He had made one of his runs in five
minutes less than the other had done, but it was by a
great exertion that left him completely exhausted when
he arrived at the station. It was during his cross-examination
that Hickory at last came in.</p>

<p>Horace Byrd, who had been growing very impatient
during the last few minutes, happened to be looking at
the door when it opened to admit this late comer. So
was Mr. Orcutt. But Byrd did not notice this, or Hickory
either. If they had, perhaps Hickory would have
been more careful to hide his feelings. As it was, he no
sooner met his colleague's eye than he gave a quick,
despondent shake of the head in intimation that he had
<i>failed</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd, who had anticipated a different result,
was greatly disappointed. His countenance fell and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
he cast a glance of compassion at Miss Dare, now
flushing with a secret but slowly growing hope. The defence,
then, was good, and she ran the risk of being interrogated
again. It was a prospect from which Mr.
Byrd recoiled.</p>

<p>As soon as Hickory got the chance, he made his way
to the side of Byrd.</p>

<p>"No go," was his low but expressive salutation. "One
hundred and five minutes is the shortest time in which I
can get over the ground, and that by a deuced hard
scramble of it too."</p>

<p>"But that's five minutes' gain on the experts," Byrd
whispered.</p>

<p>"Is it? Hope I could gain something on them, but
what's five minutes' gain in an affair like this? Fifteen
is what's wanted."</p>

<p>"I know it."</p>

<p>"And fifteen I cannot make, nor ten either, unless a
pair of wings should be given me to carry me over the
river."</p>

<p>"Sure?"</p>

<p>"Sure!"</p>

<p>Here there was some commotion in their vicinity,
owing to the withdrawal of the last witness from the
stand. Hickory took advantage of the bustle to lean
over and whisper in Byrd's ear:</p>

<p>"Do you know I think I have been watched to-day.
There was a fellow concealed in Mrs. Clemmens' house,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
who saw me leave it, and who, I have no doubt, took
express note of the time I started. And there was another
chap hanging round the station at the quarries, whom I
am almost sure had no business there unless it was to see
at what moment I arrived. He came back to Sibley
when I did, but he telegraphed first, and it is my opinion
that Orcutt&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here he was greatly startled by hearing his name
spoken in a loud and commanding tone of voice. Stopping
short, he glanced up, encountered the eye of Mr.
Orcutt fixed upon him from the other side of the court-room,
and realized he was being summoned to the witness
stand.</p>

<p>"The deuce!" he murmured, with a look at Byrd to
which none but an artist could do justice.</p>

<h3>HICKORY.</h3>

<div class='poem'>
Hickory, dickory, dock!<br />
The mouse ran up the clock!<br />
The clock struck one,<br />
And down he run!<br />
Hickory, dickory, dock!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;"><span class="smcap">&mdash;Mother Goose Melodies.</span></span><br />
<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>HICKORY'S face was no new one to the court. He
had occupied a considerable portion of one day in
giving testimony for the prosecution, and his rough manner
and hardy face, twinkling, however, at times with an
irrepressible humor that redeemed it and him from all
charge of ugliness, were well known not only to the jury
but to all the <i>habitu&eacute;s</i> of the trial. Yet, when he stepped
upon the stand at the summons of Mr. Orcutt, every eye
turned toward him with curiosity, so great was the surprise
with which his name had been hailed, and so vivid
the interest aroused in what a detective devoted to the
cause of the prosecution might have to say in the way of
supporting the defence.</div>

<p>The first question uttered by Mr. Orcutt served to put
them upon the right track.</p>

<p>"Will you tell the court where you have been to-day,
Mr. Hickory?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," replied the witness in a slow and ruminating
tone of voice, as he cast a look at Mr. Ferris, half apologetic
and half reassuring, "I have been in a good many
places&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You know what I mean," interrupted Mr. Orcutt.
"Tell the court where you were between the hours of
eleven and a quarter to one," he added, with a quick
glance at the paper he held in his hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>then</i>," cried Hickory, suddenly relaxing into his
drollest self. "Well, <i>then</i>, I was all along the route from
Sibley to Monteith Quarry Station. I don't think I was
stationary at any one minute of the time, sir."</p>

<p>"In other words&mdash;&mdash;" suggested Mr. Orcutt, severely.</p>

<p>"I was trying to show myself smarter than my betters;"
bowing with a great show of respect to the two experts
who sat near. "<i>Or</i>, in other words still, I was trying to
make the distance between Mrs. Clemmens' house and
the station I have mentioned, in time sufficient to upset
the defence, sir."</p>

<p>And the look he cast at Mr. Ferris was wholly apologetic
now.</p>

<p>"Ah, I understand, and at whose suggestion did you
undertake to do this, Mr. Hickory?"</p>

<p>"At the suggestion of a friend of mine, who is also
somewhat of a detective."</p>

<p>"And when was this suggestion given?"</p>

<p>"After your speech, sir, yesterday afternoon."</p>

<p>"And where?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span></p>

<p>"At the hotel, sir, where I and my friend put up."</p>

<p>"Did not the counsel for the prosecution order you to
make this attempt?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Did he not know you were going to make it?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Who did know it?"</p>

<p>"My friend."</p>

<p>"No one else?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, judging from my present position, I should
say there seems to have been some one else," the witness
slyly retorted.</p>

<p>The calmness with which Mr. Orcutt carried on this
examination suffered a momentary disturbance.</p>

<p>"You know what I mean," he returned. "Did you
tell any one but your friend that you were going to undertake
this run?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Mr. Hickory," the lawyer now pursued, "will you tell
us why you considered yourself qualified to succeed in an
attempt where you had already been told regular experts
had failed?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I don't know unless you find the solution
in the slightly presumptive character of my disposition."</p>

<p>"Had you ever run before or engaged in athletic
sports of any kind?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I have run before."</p>

<p>"And engaged in athletic sports?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Mr. Hickory, have you ever run in a race with men
of well-known reputation for speed?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, I have."</p>

<p>"Did you ever win in running such a race?"</p>

<p>"Once."</p>

<p>"No more?"</p>

<p>"Well, then, twice."</p>

<p>The dejection with which this last assent came forth
roused the mirth of some light-hearted, feather-headed
people, but the officers of the court soon put a stop
to that.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hickory, will you tell us whether on account of
having twice beaten in a race requiring the qualifications
of a professional runner, you considered yourself qualified
to judge of the feasibility of any other man's making
the distance from Mrs. Clemmens' house to Monteith
Quarry Station in ninety minutes by your own ability or
non-ability to do so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I did; but a man's judgment of his own
qualifications don't go very far, I've been told."</p>

<p>"I did not ask you for any remarks, Mr. Hickory.
This is a serious matter and demands serious treatment.
I asked if in undertaking to make this run in ninety minutes
you did not presume to judge of the feasibility of the
prisoner having made it in that time, and you answered,
'Yes.' It was enough."</p>

<p>The witness bowed with an air of great innocence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now," resumed the lawyer, "you say you made a run
from Mrs. Clemmens' house to Monteith Quarry Station
to-day. Before telling us in what time you did it, will
you be kind enough to say what route you took?"</p>

<p>"The one, sir, which has been pointed out by the prosecution
as that which the prisoner undoubtedly took&mdash;the
path through the woods and over the bridge to the highway.
I knew no other."</p>

<p>"Did you know <i>this?</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"How came you to know it?"</p>

<p>"I had been over it before."</p>

<p>"The whole distance?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Mr. Hickory, were you well enough acquainted with
the route not to be obliged to stop at any point during
your journey to see if you were in the right path or taking
the most direct road to your destination?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And when you got to the river?"</p>

<p>"I turned straight to the right and made for the
bridge."</p>

<p>"Did you not pause long enough to see if you could
not cross the stream in some way?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. I don't know how to swim in my clothes
and keep them dry, and as for my wings, I had unfortunately
left them at home."</p>

<p>Mr. Orcutt frowned.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>

<p>"These attempts at humor," said he, "are very <i>mal
&agrave; propos</i>, Mr. Hickory." Then, with a return to his usual
tone: "Did you cross the bridge at a run?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And did you keep up your pace when you got to the
highroad?"</p>

<p>"No, I did not."</p>

<p>"You did not?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"And why, may I ask?"</p>

<p>"I was tired."</p>

<p>"Tired?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>There was a droll demureness in the way Hickory said
this which made Mr. Orcutt pause. But in another
minute he went on.</p>

<p>"And what pace do you take when you are tired?"</p>

<p>"A horse's pace when I can get it," was the laughing
reply. "A team was going by, sir, and I just jumped up
with the driver."</p>

<p>"Ah, you rode, then, part of the way? Was it a fast
team, Mr. Hickory?"</p>

<p>"Well, it wasn't one of Bonner's."</p>

<p>"Did they go faster than a man could run?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I am obliged to say they did."</p>

<p>"And how long did you ride behind them?"</p>

<p>"Till I got in sight of the station."</p>

<p>"Why did you not go farther?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>

<p>"Because I had been told the prisoner was seen to
walk up to the station, and I meant to be fair to him
when I knew how."</p>

<p>"Oh, you did; and do you think it was fair to him to
steal a ride on the highway?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And why?"</p>

<p>"Because no one has ever told me he didn't ride down
the highway, at least till he came within sight of the
station."</p>

<p>"Mr. Hickory," inquired the lawyer, severely, "are
you in possession of any knowledge proving that he
did?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd, who had been watching the prisoner breathlessly
through all this, saw or thought he saw the faintest
shadow of an odd, disdainful smile cross his sternly composed
features at this moment. But he could not be sure.
There was enough in the possibility, however, to make
the detective thoughtful; but Mr. Orcutt proceeding
rapidly with his examination, left him no time to formulate
his sensations into words.</p>

<p>"So that by taking this wagon you are certain you lost
no time?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Rather gained some?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Mr. Hickory, will you now state whether you put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
forth your full speed to-day in going from Mrs. Clemmens'
house to the Quarry Station?"</p>

<p>"I did not."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I did not put forth any thing like my full speed, sir,"
the witness repeated, with a twinkle in the direction of
Byrd that fell just short of being a decided wink.</p>

<p>"And why, may I ask? What restrained you from
running as fast as you could? Sympathy for the defence?"</p>

<p>The ironical suggestion conveyed in this last question
gave Hickory an excuse for indulging in his peculiar
humor.</p>

<p>"No, sir; sympathy for the prosecution. I feared the
loss of one of its most humble but valuable assistants.
In other words, I was afraid I should break my neck."</p>

<p>"And why should you have any special fears of breaking
your neck?"</p>

<p>"The path is so uneven, sir. No man could run
for much of the way without endangering his life or at
least his limbs."</p>

<p>"Did you run when you could?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And in those places where you could not run, did you
proceed as fast as you knew how?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Very well; now I think it is time you told the jury
just how many minutes it took you to go from Mrs. Clemmens'
door to the Monteith Quarry Station."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, sir, according to <i>my</i> watch, it took one hundred
and five minutes."</p>

<p>Mr. Orcutt glanced impressively at the jury.</p>

<p>"One hundred and five minutes," he repeated. He
then turned to the witness with his concluding questions.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hickory, were you present in the court-room just
now when the two experts whom I have employed to
make the run gave their testimony?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Do you know in what time they made it?"</p>

<p>"I believe I do. I was told by the person whom I informed
of my failure that I had gained five minutes upon
them."</p>

<p>"And what did you reply?"</p>

<p>"That I hoped I could make something on <i>them;</i> but
that five minutes wasn't much when a clean fifteen was
wanted," returned Hickory, with another droll look at the
experts and an askance appeal at Byrd, which being translated
might read: "How in the deuce could this man have
known what I was whispering to you on the other side of
the court-room? Is he a wizard, this Orcutt?"</p>

<p>He forgot that a successful lawyer is always more or
less of a wizard.</p>

<h2>XXXIII.</h2>

<h3>A LATE DISCOVERY.</h3>

<div class='center'>
Oh, torture me no more, I will confess.&mdash;<span class="smcap">King Lear.</span><br />
<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>WITH the cross-examination of Hickory, the defence
rested, and the day being far advanced,
the court adjourned.</div>

<p>During the bustle occasioned by the departure of the
prisoner, Mr. Byrd took occasion to glance at the faces
of those most immediately concerned in the trial.</p>

<p>His first look naturally fell upon Mr. Orcutt. Ah! all
was going well with the great lawyer. Hope, if not
triumph, beamed in his eye and breathed in every movement
of his alert and nervous form. He was looking
across the court-room at Imogene Dare, and his features
wore a faint smile that indelibly impressed itself upon
Mr. Byrd's memory. Perhaps because there was something
really peculiar and remarkable in its expression,
and perhaps because of the contrast it offered to his own
feelings of secret doubt and dread.</p>

<p>His next look naturally followed that of Mr. Orcutt
and rested upon Imogene Dare. Ah! she was under
the spell of awakening hope also. It was visible in her
lightened brow, her calmer and less studied aspect,
her eager and eloquently speaking gaze yet lingering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
on the door through which the prisoner had departed.
As Mr. Byrd marked this look of hers and noted all it
revealed, he felt his emotions rise till they almost confounded
him. But strong as they were, they deepened
still further when, in another moment, he beheld her suddenly
drop her eyes from the door and turn them slowly,
reluctantly but gratefully, upon Mr. Orcutt. All the
story of her life was in that change of look; all the story
of her future, too, perhaps, if&mdash;&mdash; Mr. Byrd dared not
trust himself to follow the contingency that lurked behind
that <i>if</i>, and, to divert his mind, turned his attention
to Mr. Ferris.</p>

<p>But he found small comfort there. For the District
Attorney was not alone. Hickory stood at his side, and
Hickory was whispering in his ear, and Mr. Byrd,
who knew what was weighing on his colleague's mind,
found no difficulty in interpreting the mingled expression
of perplexity and surprise that crossed the dark, aquiline
features of the District Attorney as he listened with
slightly bended head to what the detective had to say.
That look and the deep, anxious frown which crossed his
brow as he glanced up and encountered Imogene's eye,
remained in Mr. Byrd's mind long after the court-room
was empty and he had returned to his hotel. It mingled
with the smile of strange satisfaction which he had
detected on Mr. Orcutt's face, and awakened such a turmoil
of contradictory images in his mind that he was glad
when Hickory at last came in to break the spell.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span></p>

<p>Their meeting was singular, and revealed, as by a flash,
the difference between the two men. Byrd contented
himself with giving Hickory a look and saying nothing,
while Hickory bestowed upon Byrd a hearty "Well, old
fellow!" and broke out into a loud and by no means unenjoyable
laugh.</p>

<p>"You didn't expect to see me mounting the rostrum
in favor of the defence, did you?" he asked, after he had
indulged himself as long as he saw fit in the display
of this somewhat unseasonable mirth. "Well, it was a
surprise. But I've done it for Orcutt now!"</p>

<p>"You have?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have."</p>

<p>"But the prosecution has closed its case?"</p>

<p>"Bah! what of that?" was the careless reply. "The
District Attorney can get it reopened. No Court would
refuse that."</p>

<p>Horace surveyed his colleague for a moment in
silence.</p>

<p>"So Mr. Ferris was struck with the point you gave
him?" he ventured, at last.</p>

<p>"Well, sufficiently so to be uneasy," was Hickory's
somewhat dry response.</p>

<p>The look with which Byrd answered him was eloquent.
"And that makes you cheerful?" he inquired, with ill-concealed
sarcasm.</p>

<p>"Well, it has a slight tendency that way," drawled the
other, seemingly careless of the other's expression, if, indeed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
he had noted it. "You see," he went on, with a
meaning wink and a smile of utter unconcern, "all my
energies just now are concentrated on getting myself even
with that somewhat too wide-awake lawyer." And his
smile broadened till it merged into a laugh that was rasping
enough to Byrd's more delicate and generous sensibilities.</p>

<p>"Sufficiently so to be uneasy!" Yes, that was it. From
the minute Mr. Ferris listened to the suggestion that Miss
Dare had not told all she knew about the murder, and
that a question relative to where she had been at the
time it was perpetrated would, in all probability, bring
strange revelations to light, he had been awakened to a
most uncomfortable sense of his position and the
duty that was possibly required of him. To be sure, the
time for presenting testimony to the court was passed, unless
it was in the way of rebuttal; but how did he
know but what Miss Dare had a fact at her command
which would help the prosecution in overturning the
strange, unexpected, yet simple theory of the defence?
At all events, he felt he ought to know whether, in giving
her testimony she had exhausted her knowledge on
this subject, or whether, in her sympathy for the accused,
she had kept back certain evidence which if
presented might bring the crime more directly home to
the prisoner. Accordingly, somewhere toward eight
o'clock in the evening, he sought her out with the bold
resolution of forcing her to satisfy him on this point.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span></p>

<p>He did not find his task so easy, however, when he
came into direct contact with her stately and far from encouraging
presence, and met the look of surprise not unmixed
with alarm with which she greeted him. She
looked very weary, too, and yet unnaturally excited, as if
she had not slept for many nights, if indeed she had
rested at all since the trial began. It struck him as cruel
to further disturb this woman, and yet the longer he surveyed
her, the more he studied her pale, haughty, inscrutable
face, he became the more assured that he
would never feel satisfied with himself if he did not give
her an immediate opportunity to disperse at once and forever
these freshly awakened doubts.</p>

<p>His attitude or possibly his expression must have
betrayed something of his anxiety if not of his resolve,
for her countenance fell as she watched him, and her voice
sounded quite unnatural as she strove to ask to what
she was indebted for this unexpected visit.</p>

<p>He did not keep her in suspense.</p>

<p>"Miss Dare," said he, not without kindness, for he was
very sorry for this woman, despite the inevitable prejudice
which her relations to the accused had awakened,
"I would have given much not to have been obliged to
disturb you to-night, but my duty would not allow it.
There is a question which I have hitherto omitted to
ask&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused, shocked; she was swaying from side
to side before his eyes, and seemed indeed about to fall.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
But at the outreaching of his hand she recovered herself
and stood erect, the noblest spectacle of a woman
triumphing over the weakness of her body by the
mere force of her indomitable will, that he had ever
beheld.</p>

<p>"Sit down," he gently urged, pushing toward her a
chair. "You have had a hard and dreary week of it;
you are in need of rest."</p>

<p>She did not refuse to avail herself of the chair, though,
as he could not help but notice, she did not thereby relax
one iota of the restraint she put upon herself.</p>

<p>"I do not understand," she murmured; "what question?"</p>

<p>"Miss Dare, in all you have told the court, in all that
you have told me, about this fatal and unhappy affair, you
have never informed us how it was you first came
to hear of it. You were&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I heard it on the street corner," she interrupted, with
what seemed to him an almost feverish haste.</p>

<p>"First?"</p>

<p>"Yes, first."</p>

<p>"Miss Dare, had you been in the street long? Were
you in it at the time the murder happened, do you
think?"</p>

<p>"I in the street?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he repeated, conscious from the sudden strange
alteration in her look that he had touched upon a point
which, to her, was vital with some undefined interest,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
possibly that to which the surmises of Hickory had supplied
a clue. "Were you in the street, or anywhere out-of-doors
at the time the murder occurred? It strikes me
that it would be well for me to know."</p>

<p>"Sir," she cried, rising in her sudden indignation, "I
thought the time for questions had passed. What means
this sudden inquiry into a matter we have all considered
exhausted, certainly as far as I am concerned."</p>

<p>"Shall I show you?" he cried, taking her by the hand
and leading her toward the mirror near by, under one of
those impulses which sometimes effect so much. "Look
in there at your own face and you will see why I press
this question upon you."</p>

<p>Astonished, if not awed, she followed with her eyes the
direction of his pointing finger, and anxiously surveyed
her own image in the glass. Then, with a quick movement,
her hands went up before her face&mdash;which till that
moment had kept its counsel so well&mdash;and, tottering back
against a table, she stood for a moment communing with
herself, and possibly summoning up her courage for the
conflict she evidently saw before her.</p>

<p>"What is it you wish to know?" she faintly inquired,
after a long period of suspense and doubt.</p>

<p>"Where were you when the clock struck twelve on the
day Mrs. Clemmens was murdered?"</p>

<p>Instantly dropping her hands, she turned toward him
with a sudden lift of her majestic figure that was as imposing
as it was unexpected.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was at Professor Darling's house," she declared,
with great steadiness.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris had not expected this reply, and looked at
her for an instant almost as if he felt inclined to repeat
his inquiry.</p>

<p>"Do you doubt my word?" she queried. "Is it possible
you question my truth at a time like this?"</p>

<p>"No, Miss Dare," he gravely assured her. "After the
great sacrifice you have publicly made in the interests of
justice, it would be worse than presumptuous in me to
doubt your sincerity now."</p>

<p>She drew a deep breath, and straightened herself still
more proudly.</p>

<p>"Then am I to understand you are satisfied with the
answer you have received?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you will also add that you were in the observatory
at Professor Darling's house," he responded quickly,
convinced there was some mystery here, and seeing but
one way to reach it.</p>

<p>"Very well, then, I was," she averred, without hesitation.</p>

<p>"You were!" he echoed, advancing upon her with a
slight flush on his middle-aged cheek, that evinced how
difficult it was for him to pursue this conversation in face
of the haughty and repellant bearing she had assumed.
"You will, perhaps, tell me, then, why you did not see
and respond to the girl who came into that room at this
very time, with a message from a lady who waited below
to see you?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah!" she cried, succumbing with a suppressed
moan to the inexorable destiny that pursued her in this
man, "you have woven a net for me!"</p>

<p>And she sank again into a chair, where she sat like one
stunned, looking at him with a hollow gaze which filled
his heart with compassion, but which had no power to
shake his purpose as a District Attorney.</p>

<p>"Yes," he acknowledged, after a moment, "I have
woven a net for you, but only because I am anxious for
the truth, and desirous of furthering the ends of justice.
I am confident you know more about this crime than you
have ever revealed, Miss Dare; that you are acquainted
with some fact that makes you certain Mr. Mansell committed
this murder, notwithstanding the defence advanced
in his favor. What is this fact? It is my office to inquire.
True," he admitted, seeing her draw back with
denial written on every line of her white face, "you have
a right to refuse to answer me here, but you will have no
right to refuse to answer me to-morrow when I put the
same question to you in the presence of judge and jury."</p>

<p>"And"&mdash;her voice was so husky he could but with
difficulty distinguish her words&mdash;"do you intend to recall
me to the stand to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"I am obliged to, Miss Dare."</p>

<p>"But I thought the time for examination was over;
that the witnesses had all testified, and that nothing remained
now but for the lawyers to sum up."</p>

<p>"When in a case like this the prisoner offers a defence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
not anticipated by the prosecution, the latter, of course,
has the right to meet such defence with proof in rebuttal."</p>

<p>"Proof in rebuttal? What is that?"</p>

<p>"Evidence to rebut or prove false the matters advanced in
support of the defence."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>"I must do it in this case&mdash;if I can, of course."</p>

<p>She did not reply.</p>

<p>"And even if the testimony I desire to put in is not
rebuttal in its character, no unbiassed judge would deny
to counsel the privilege of reopening his case when any
new or important fact has come to light."</p>

<p>As if overwhelmed by a prospect she had not anticipated,
she hurriedly arose and pointed down the room to
a curtained recess.</p>

<p>"Give me five minutes," she cried; "five minutes by
myself where no one can look at me, and where I can
think undisturbed upon what I had better do."</p>

<p>"Very well," he acquiesced; "you shall have them."</p>

<p>She at once crossed to the small retreat.</p>

<p>"Five minutes," she reiterated huskily, as she lifted
the curtains aside; "when the clock strikes nine I will
come out."</p>

<p>"You will?" he repeated, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>The curtains fell behind her, and for five long minutes
Mr. Ferris paced the room alone. He was far from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
easy. All was so quiet behind that curtain,&mdash;so preternaturally
quiet. But he would not disturb her; no, he
had promised, and she should be left to fight her battle
alone. When nine o'clock struck, however, he started, and
owned to himself some secret dread. Would she come
forth or would he have to seek her in her place of seclusion?
It seemed he would have to seek her, for the curtains
did not stir, and by no sound from within was any
token given that she had heard the summons. Yet he
hesitated, and as he did so, a thought struck him. Could
it be there was any outlet from the refuge she had
sought? Had she taken advantage of his consideration
to escape him? Moved by the fear, he hastily crossed
the room. But before he could lay his <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'band'">hand</ins> upon the
curtains, they parted, and disclosed the form of Imogene.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/ill04.jpg" width="450" height="450" alt="&quot;The curtains parted and disclosed the form of Imogene. &#39;I am coming,&#39; she murmured, and stepped forth.&quot;&mdash;(Page 402.)" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;The curtains parted and disclosed the form of Imogene. &#39;I am coming,&#39; she murmured, and stepped forth.&quot;&mdash;(Page 402.)</span>
</div>

<p>"I am coming," she murmured, and stepped forth
more like a faintly-breathing image than a living
woman.</p>

<p>His first glance at her face convinced him she had
taken her resolution. His second, that in taking it she
had drifted into a state of feeling different from any he
had observed in her before, and of a sort that to him was
wholly inexplicable. Her words when she spoke only
deepened this impression.</p>


<p>"Mr. Ferris," said she, coming very near to him in
evident dread of being overheard, "I have decided to
tell you all. I hoped never to be obliged to do this. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
thought enough had been revealed to answer your purpose.
I&mdash;I believed Heaven would spare me this last
trial, let me keep this last secret. It was of so strange a
nature, so totally out of the reach of any man's surmise.
But the finger of God is on me. It has followed this
crime from the beginning, and there is no escape. By
some strange means, some instinct of penetration, perhaps,
you have discovered that I know something concerning
this murder of which I have never told you, and
that the hour I spent at Professor Darling's is accountable
for this knowledge. Sir, I cannot struggle with
Providence. I will tell you all I have hitherto hidden
from the world if you will promise to let me know if my
words will prove fatal, and if he&mdash;he who is on trial for
his life&mdash;will be lost if I give to the court my last evidence
against him?"</p>

<p>"But, Miss Dare," remonstrated the District Attorney,
"no man can tell&mdash;&mdash;" He did not finish his sentence.
Something in the feverish gaze she fixed upon him
stopped him. He felt that he could not palter with a
woman in the grasp of an agony like this. So, starting
again, he observed: "Let me hear what you have to say,
and afterward we will consider what the effect of it may
be; though a question of expediency should not come
into your consideration, Miss Dare, in telling such truths
as the law demands."</p>

<p>"No?" she broke out, giving way for one instant to a
low and terrible laugh which curdled Mr. Ferris' blood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
and made him wish his duty had led him into the midst
of any other scene than this.</p>

<p>But before he could remonstrate with her, this harrowing
expression of misery had ceased, and she was saying
in quiet and suppressed tones:</p>

<p>"The reason I did not see and respond to the girl who
came into the observatory on the morning of Mrs. Clemmens'
murder is, that I was so absorbed in the discoveries
I was making behind the high rack which shuts off one
end of the room, that any appeal to me at that time must
have passed unnoticed. I had come to Professor Darling's
house, according to my usual custom on Tuesday
mornings, to study astronomy with his daughter Helen.
I had come reluctantly, for my mind was full of the secret
intention I had formed of visiting Mrs. Clemmens in
the afternoon, and I had no heart for study. But finding
Miss Darling out, I felt a drawing toward the seclusion I
knew I should find in the observatory, and mounting to
it, I sat down by myself to think. The rest and quiet of
the place were soothing to me, and I sat still a long time,
but suddenly becoming impressed with the idea that it
was growing late, I went to the window to consult the
town-clock. But though its face could be plainly seen
from the observatory, its hands could not, and I was about
to withdraw from the window when I remembered the
telescope, which Miss Darling and I had, in a moment of
caprice a few days before, so arranged as to command a
view of the town. Going to it, I peered through it at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
clock." Stopping, she surveyed the District Attorney with
breathless suspense. "It was just five minutes to twelve,"
she impressively whispered.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris felt a shock.</p>

<p>"A critical moment!" he exclaimed. Then, with a
certain intuition of what she was going to say next, inquired:
"And what then, Miss Dare?"</p>

<p>"I was struck by a desire to see if I could detect Mrs.
Clemmens' house from where I was, and shifting the
telescope slightly, I looked through it again, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What did you see, Miss Dare?"</p>

<p>"I saw her dining-room door standing ajar and a
man leaping headlong over the fence toward the
bog."</p>

<p>The District Attorney started, looked at her with growing
interest, and inquired:</p>

<p>"Did you recognize this man, Miss Dare?"</p>

<p>She nodded in great agitation.</p>

<p>"Who was he?"</p>

<p>"Craik Mansell."</p>

<p>"Miss Dare," ventured Mr. Ferris, after a moment,
"you say this was five minutes to twelve?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," was the faint reply.</p>

<p>"Five minutes later than the time designated by the
defence as a period manifestly too late for the prisoner to
have left Mrs. Clemmens' house and arrived at the
Quarry Station at twenty minutes past one?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she repeated, below her breath.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span></p>

<p>The District Attorney surveyed her earnestly, perceiving
she had not only spoken the truth, but realized all
which that truth implied, and drew back a few steps muttering
ironically to himself:</p>

<p>"Ah, Orcutt! Orcutt!"</p>

<p>Breathlessly she watched him, breathlessly she followed
him step by step like some white and haunting spirit.</p>

<p>"You believe, then, this fact will cost him his life?"
came from her lips at last.</p>

<p>"Don't ask me that, Miss Dare. You and I have no
concern with the consequences of this evidence."</p>

<p>"No concern?" she repeated, wildly. "You and I
no concern? Ah!" she went on, with heart-piercing
sarcasm, "I forgot that the sentiments of the heart have
no place in judicial investigation. A criminal is but
lawful prey, and it is every good citizen's duty to push
him to his doom. No matter if one is bound to that
criminal by the dearest ties which can unite two hearts;
no matter if the trust he has bestowed upon you has been
absolute and unquestioning, the law does not busy itself
with that. The law says if you have a word at your
command which can destroy this man, give utterance to
it; and the law must be obeyed."</p>

<p>"But, Miss Dare&mdash;&mdash;" the District Attorney hastily intervened,
startled by the feverish gleam of her hitherto
calm eye.</p>

<p>But she was not to be stopped, now that her misery had
at last found words.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span></p>

<p>"You do not understand my position, perhaps," she
continued. "You do not see that it has been my hand,
and mine only, which, from the first, has slowly, remorselessly
pushed this man back from the point of safety, till
now, now, I am called upon to drag from his hand the one
poor bending twig to which he clings, and upon which he
relies to support him above the terrible gulf that yawns at
his feet. You do not see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pardon me," interposed Mr. Ferris again, anxious, if
possible, to restore her to herself. "I see enough to pity
you profoundly. But you must allow me to remark that
your hand is not the only one which has been instrumental
in hurrying this young man to his doom. The
detectives&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sir," she interrupted in her turn, "can you, dare you
say, that without my testimony he would have stood at
any time in a really critical position?&mdash;or that he would
stand in jeopardy of his life even now, if it were not for
this fact I have to tell?"</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris was silent.</p>

<p>"Oh, I knew it, I knew it!" she cried. "There will be
no doubt concerning whose testimony it was that convicted
him, if he is sentenced by the court for this crime.
Ah, ah, what an enviable position is mine! What an
honorable deed I am called upon to perform! To tell the
truth at the expense of the life most dear to you. It is a
Roman virtue! I shall be held up as a model to my sex.
All the world must shower plaudits upon the woman who,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
sooner than rob justice of its due, delivered her own lover
over to the hangman."</p>

<p>Pausing in her passionate burst, she turned her hot, dry
eyes in a sort of desperation upon his face.</p>

<p>"Do you know," she gurgled in his ear, "some women
would kill themselves before they would do this deed."</p>

<p>Struck to his heart in spite of himself, Mr. Ferris looked
at her in alarm&mdash;saw her standing there with her arms
hanging down at her sides, but with her two hands clinched
till they looked as if carved from marble&mdash;and drew near
to her with the simple hurried question of:</p>

<p>"But you?"</p>

<p>"I?" she laughed again&mdash;a low, gurgling laugh, that
yet had a tone in it that went to the other's heart and
awoke strange sensations there. "Oh, I shall live to respond
to your questions. Do not fear that I shall not be
in the court-room to-morrow."</p>

<p>There was something in her look and manner that
was new. It awed him, while it woke all his latent concern.</p>

<p>"Miss Dare," he began, "you can believe how painful
all this has been to me, and how I would have spared you
this misery if I could. But the responsibilities resting upon
me are such&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He did not go on; why should he? She was not listening.
To be sure, she stood before him, seemingly attentive,
but the eyes with which she met his were fixed
upon other objects than any which could have been apparent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
to her in his face; and her form, which she had
hitherto held upright, was shaking with long, uncontrollable
shudders, which, to his excited imagination,
threatened to lay her at his feet.</p>

<p>He at once started toward the door for help. But she
was alive to his movements if not to his words. Stopping
him with a gesture, she cried:</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no! do not call for any one; I wish to be alone;
I have <i>my</i> duty to face, you know; my testimony to prepare."
And rousing herself she cast a peculiar look about
the room, like one suddenly introduced into a strange place,
and then moving slowly toward the window, threw back
the curtain and gazed without. "Night!" she murmured,
"night!" and after a moment added, in a deep, unearthly
voice that thrilled irresistibly upon Mr. Ferris' ear:
"And a heaven full of stars!"</p>

<p>Her face, as she turned it upward, wore so strange a
look, Mr. Ferris involuntarily left his position and crossed
to her side. She was still murmuring to herself in seeming
unconsciousness of his presence. "Stars!" she was
repeating; "and above them God!" And the long
shudders shook her frame again, and she dropped her
head and seemed about to fall into her old abstraction
when her eye encountered that of the District Attorney,
and she hurriedly aroused herself.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," she exclaimed, with an ill-concealed
irony, particularly impressive after her tone of the moment
before, "have you any thing further to exact of me?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," he made haste to reply; "only before I go I
would entreat you to be calm&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And say the word I have to say to-morrow without a
balk and without an <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'unneccessary'">unnecessary</ins> display of feeling," she
coldly interpolated. "Thanks, Mr. Ferris, I understand
you. But you need fear nothing from me. There will
be no scene&mdash;at least on my part&mdash;when I rise before the
court to give my testimony to-morrow. Since my hand
must strike the fatal blow, it shall strike&mdash;firmly!" and
her clenched fist fell heavily on her own breast, as if the
blow she meditated must first strike there.</p>

<p>The District Attorney, more moved than he had deemed
it possible for him to be, made her a low bow and withdrew
slowly to the door.</p>

<p>"I leave you, then, till to-morrow," he said.</p>

<p>"Till to-morrow."</p>

<p>Long after he had passed out, the deep meaning which
informed those two words haunted his memory and disturbed
his heart. Till to-morrow! Alas, poor girl! and
after to-morrow, what then?</p>

<h2>XXXIV.</h2>

<h3>WHAT WAS HID BEHIND IMOGENE'S VEIL.</h3>

<div class='center'>
Mark now, how a plain tale shall put you down.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Henry IV.</span><br />
<br  /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>THE few minutes that elapsed before the formal
opening of court the next morning were marked
by great cheerfulness. The crisp frosty air had put everybody
in a good-humor. Even the prisoner looked less
sombre than before, and for the first time since the
beginning of his trial, deigned to turn his eyes toward
the bench where Imogene sat, with a look that, while it
was not exactly kind, had certainly less disdain in it than
before he saw his way to a possible acquittal on the
theory advanced by his counsel.</div>

<p>But this look, though his first, did not prove to be his
last. Something in the attitude of the woman he gazed
at&mdash;or was it the mystery of the heavy black veil that
enveloped her features?&mdash;woke a strange doubt in his
mind. Beckoning to Mr. Orcutt, he communicated with
him in a low tone.</p>

<p>"Can it be possible," asked he, "that any thing new
could have transpired since last night to give encouragement
to the prosecution?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span></p>

<p>The lawyer, startled, glanced hastily about him and
shook his head.</p>

<p>"No," he cried; "impossible! What could have
transpired?"</p>

<p>"Look at Mr. Ferris," whispered the prisoner, "and
then at the witness who wears a veil."</p>

<p>With an unaccountable feeling of reluctance, Mr.
Orcutt hastily complied. His first glance at the District
Attorney made him thoughtful. He recognized the look
which his opponent wore; he had seen it many a time
before this, and knew what it indicated. As for Imogene,
who could tell what went on in that determined breast?
The close black veil revealed nothing. Mr. Orcutt impatiently
turned back to his client.</p>

<p>"I think you alarm yourself unnecessarily," he whispered.
"Ferris means to fight, but what of that? He
wouldn't be fit for his position if he didn't struggle to
the last gasp even for a failing cause."</p>

<p>Yet in saying this his lip took its sternest line, and from
the glitter of his eye and the close contraction of his brow
it looked as if he were polishing his own weapons for the
conflict he thus unexpectedly saw before him.</p>

<p>Meantime, across the court-room, another whispered
conference was going on.</p>

<p>"Hickory, where have you been ever since last night?
I have not been able to find you anywhere."</p>

<p>"I was on duty; I had a bird to look after."</p>

<p>"A bird?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, a wild bird; one who is none too fond of its
cage; a desperate one who might find means to force
aside its bars and fly away."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Hickory? What nonsense is
this?"</p>

<p>"Look at Miss Dare and perhaps you will understand."</p>

<p>"Miss Dare?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Horace's eyes opened in secret alarm.</p>

<p>"Do you mean&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I mean that I spent the whole night in tramping up
and down in front of her window. And a dismal task it
was too. Her lamp burned till daylight."</p>

<p>Here the court was called to order and Byrd had only
opportunity to ask:</p>

<p>"Why does she wear a veil?"</p>

<p>To which the other whisperingly retorted:</p>

<p>"Why did she spend the whole night in packing up her
worldly goods and writing a letter to the Congregational
minister to be sent after the adjournment of court to-day?"</p>

<p>"Did she do that?"</p>

<p>"She did."</p>

<p>"Hickory, don't <i>you</i> know&mdash;haven't you been told
what she is expected to say or do here to-day?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You only guess?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, I don't guess."</p>

<p>"You fear, then?"</p>

<p>"Fear! Well, that's a big word to a fellow like me.
I don't know as I fear any thing; I'm curious, that is
all."</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd drew back, looked over at Imogene, and involuntarily
shook his head. What was in the mind of
this mysterious woman? What direful purpose or shadow
of doom lay behind the veil that separated her from the
curiosity and perhaps the sympathy of the surrounding
crowd? It was in vain to question; he could only wait
in secret anxiety for the revelations which the next few
minutes might bring.</p>

<p>The defence having rested the night before, the first
action of the Judge on the opening of the court was to
demand whether the prosecution had any rebuttal testimony
to offer.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris instantly rose.</p>

<p>"Miss Dare, will you retake the stand," said he.</p>

<p>Immediately Mr. Orcutt, who up to the last moment
had felt his case as secure as if it had indeed been
founded on a rock, bounded to his feet, white as the
witness herself.</p>

<p>"I object!" he cried. "The witness thus recalled by
the counsel of the prosecution has had ample opportunity
to lay before the court all the evidence in her possession.
I submit it to the court whether my learned opponent
should not have exhausted his witness before he rested
his case."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Ferris," asked the Judge, turning to the District
Attorney, "do you recall this witness for the purpose of
introducing fresh testimony in support of your case or
merely to disprove the defence?"</p>

<p>"Your honor," was the District Attorney's reply, "I
ought to say in fairness to my adversary and to the court,
that since the case was closed a fact has come to my
knowledge of so startling and conclusive a nature that I
feel bound to lay it before the jury. From this witness
alone can we hope to glean this fact; and as I had no
information on which to base a question concerning it in
her former examination, I beg the privilege of reopening
my case to that extent."</p>

<p>"Then the evidence you desire to submit is not in rebuttal?"
queried the Judge.</p>

<p>"I do not like to say that," rejoined the District
Attorney, adroitly. "I think it may bear directly upon
the question whether the prisoner could catch the train
at Monteith Quarry if he left the widow's house after the
murder. If the evidence I am about to offer be true, he
certainly could."</p>

<p>Thoroughly alarmed now and filled with the dismay
which a mysterious threat is always calculated to produce,
Mr. Orcutt darted a wild look of inquiry at Imogene,
and finding her immovable behind her thick veil,
turned about and confronted the District Attorney with
a most sarcastic smile upon his blanched and trembling
lips.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></p>

<p>"Does my learned friend suppose the court will receive
any such ambiguous explanation as this? If the
testimony sought from this witness is by way of rebuttal,
let him say so; but if it is not, let him be frank enough
to admit it, that I may in turn present my objections
to the introduction of any irrelevant evidence at this
time."</p>

<p>"The testimony I propose to present through this witness
<i>is</i> in the way of rebuttal," returned Mr Ferris,
severely. "The argument advanced by the defence, that
the prisoner could not have left Mrs. Clemmens' house
at ten minutes before twelve and arrived at Monteith
Quarry Station at twenty minutes past one, is not a tenable
one, and I purpose to prove it by this witness."</p>

<p>Mr. Orcutt's look of anxiety changed to one of mingled
amazement and incredulity.</p>

<p>"By <i>this</i> witness! You have chosen a peculiar one for
the purpose," he ironically exclaimed, more and more
shaken from his self-possession by the quiet bearing
of his opponent, and the silent air of waiting which
marked the stately figure of her whom, as he had
hitherto believed, he thoroughly comprehended. "Your
Honor," he continued, "I withdraw my objections; I
should really like to hear how Miss Dare or any lady can
give evidence on this point."</p>

<p>And he sank back into his seat with a look at his
client in which professional bravado strangely struggled
with something even deeper than alarm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span></p>

<p>"This must be an exciting moment to the prisoner,"
whispered Hickory to Byrd.</p>

<p>"So, so. But mark his control, will you? He is less
cut up than Orcutt."</p>

<p>"Look at his eyes, though. If any thing could pierce
that veil of hers, you would think such a glance might."</p>

<p>"Ah, he <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'his'">is</ins> trying his influence over her at last."</p>

<p>"But it is too late."</p>

<p>Meantime the District Attorney had signified again to
Miss Dare his desire that she should take the stand.
Slowly, and like a person in a dream, she arose, unloosed
her veil, dragged it from before her set features, and
stepped mechanically forward to the place assigned her.
What was there in the face thus revealed that called
down an instantaneous silence upon the court, and made
the momentary pause that ensued memorable in the
minds of all present? It was not that she was so pale,
though her close-fitting black dress, totally unrelieved by
any suspicion of white, was of a kind to bring out
any startling change in her complexion; nor was there
visible in her bearing any trace of the feverish excitement
which had characterized it the evening before;
yet of all the eyes that were fixed upon her&mdash;and there
were many in that crowd whose only look a moment
before had been one of heartless curiosity&mdash;there were
none which were not filled with compassion and more or
less dread.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, she remained like a statue on the spot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
where she had taken her stand, and her eyes, which
in her former examination had met the court with the
unflinching gaze of an automaton, were lowered till the
lashes swept her cheek.</p>

<p>"Miss Dare," asked the District Attorney, as soon as
he could recover from his own secret emotions of pity
and regret, "will you tell us where you were at the
hour of noon on the morning Mrs. Clemmens was
murdered?"</p>

<p>Before she could answer, before in fact her stiff and
icy lips could part, Mr. Orcutt had risen impetuously to
his feet, like a man bound to contend every step of the
way with the unknown danger that menaced him.</p>

<p>"I object!" he cried, in the changed voice of a
deeply disturbed man, while those who had an interest in
the prisoner at this juncture, could not but notice that
he, too, showed signs of suppressed feeling, and for the
first time since the beginning of the trial, absolutely
found his self-command insufficient to keep down the
rush of color that swept up to his swarthy cheek.</p>

<p>"The question," continued Mr. Orcutt, "is not to
elicit testimony in rebuttal."</p>

<p>"Will my learned friend allow the witness to give her
answer, instead of assuming what it is to be?"</p>

<p>"I will not," retorted his adversary. "A child could
see that such a question is not admissible at this stage of
the case."</p>

<p>"I am sure my learned friend would not wish me to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
associate <i>him</i> with any such type of inexperience?"
suggested Mr. Ferris, grimly.</p>

<p>But the sarcasm, which at one time would have called
forth a stinging retort from Mr. Orcutt, passed unheeded.
The great lawyer was fighting for his life, for his heart's
life, for the love and hand of Imogene&mdash;a recompense
which at this moment her own unconsidered action, or
the constraining power of a conscience of whose might
he had already received such heart-rending manifestation,
seemed about to snatch from his grasp forever. Turning
to the Judge, he said:</p>

<p>"I will not delay the case by bandying words with my
esteemed friend, but appeal at once to the Court as to
whether the whereabouts of Miss Dare on that fatal
morning can have any thing to do with the defence we
have proved."</p>

<p>"Your Honor," commenced the District Attorney,
calmly following the lead of his adversary, "I am ready
to stake my reputation on the declaration that this witness
is in possession of a fact that overturns the whole
fabric of the defence. If the particular question I have
made use of, in my endeavor to elicit this fact, is displeasing
to my friend, I will venture upon another less
ambiguous, if more direct and perhaps leading." And
turning again to the witness, Mr. Ferris calmly inquired:</p>

<p>"Did you or did you not see the prisoner on the
morning of the assault, at a time distinctly known by you
to be after ten minutes to twelve?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span></p>

<p>It was out. The line of attack meditated by Mr.
Ferris was patent to everybody. A murmur of surprise
and interest swept through the court-room, while Mr.
Orcutt, who in spite of his vague fears was any thing but
prepared for a thrust of this vital nature, started and
cast short demanding looks from Imogene to Mansell, as
if he would ask them what fact this was which through
ignorance or presumption they had conspired to keep
from him. The startled look which he surprised on the
stern face of the prisoner, showed him there was every
thing to fear in her reply, and bounding again to his feet,
he was about to make some further attempt to stave off
the impending calamity, when the rich voice of Imogene
was heard saying:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, if you will allow me to tell my story unhindered,
I think I shall soonest satisfy both the District
Attorney and the counsel for the prisoner."</p>

<p>And raising her eyes with a slow and heavy movement
from the floor, she fixed them in a meaning way upon the
latter.</p>

<p>At once convinced that he had been unnecessarily
alarmed, Mr. Orcutt sank back into his seat, and Imogene
slowly proceeded.</p>

<p>She commenced in a forced tone and with a sudden
quick shudder that made her words come hesitatingly
and with strange breaks: "I have been asked&mdash;two questions
by Mr. Ferris&mdash;I prefer&mdash;to answer the first. He
asked me&mdash;where I was at the hour Mrs. Clemmens was
murdered."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span></p>

<p>She paused so long one had time to count her breaths
as they came in gasps to her white lips.</p>

<p>"I have no further desire to hide from you the truth.
I was with Mrs. Clemmens in her own house."</p>

<p>At this acknowledgment so astonishing, and besides so
totally different from the one he had been led to expect,
Mr. Ferris started as if a thunder-bolt had fallen at his
feet.</p>

<p>"In Mrs. Clemmens' house!" he repeated, amid the
excited hum of a hundred murmuring voices. "Did you
say, in Mrs. Clemmens' house?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she returned, with a wild, ironical smile that at
once assured Mr. Ferris of his helplessness. "I am on
oath <i>now</i>, and I assert that on the day and at the
hour Mrs. Clemmens was murdered, I was in her house
and in her dining-room. I had come there secretly," she
proceeded, with a sudden feverish fluency that robbed
Mr. Ferris of speech, and in fact held all her auditors
spell-bound. "I had been spending an hour or so at
Professor Darling's, whose house in West Side is, as
many here know, at the very end of Summer Avenue, and
close to the woods that run along back of Mrs. Clemmens'
cottage. I had been sitting alone in the observatory,
which is at the top of one of the towers, but being suddenly
seized with a desire to see the widow and make
that promised attempt at persuading her to reconsider
her decision in regard to the money her&mdash;her&mdash;the
prisoner wanted, I came down, and unknown to any one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
in the house, stole away to the woods and so to the
widow's cottage. It was noon when I got there, or very
near it, for her company, if she had had any, was gone,
and she was engaged in setting the clock where&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Why did she pause? The District Attorney, utterly
stupefied by his surprise, had made no sign; neither had
Mr. Orcutt. Indeed, it looked as if the latter could
not have moved, much less spoken, even if he had desired
it. Thought, feeling, life itself, seemed to be at a
standstill within him as he sat with a face like clay, waiting
for words whose import he perhaps saw foreshadowed
in her wild and terrible mien. But though his aspect was
enough to stop her, it was not upon him she was gazing
when the words tripped on her lips. It was upon the
prisoner, on the man who up to this time had borne himself
with such iron-like composure and reserve, but who
now, with every sign of feeling and alarm, had started
forward and stood surveying her, with his hand uplifted
in the authoritative manner of a master.</p>

<p>The next instant he sank back, feeling the eye of the
Judge upon him; but the signal had been made, and
many in that court-room looked to see Imogene falter or
break down. But she, although fascinated, perhaps
moved, by this hint of feeling from one who had hitherto
met all the exigencies of the hour with a steady and firm
composure, did not continue silent at his bidding. On
the contrary, her purpose, whatever it was, seemed to acquire
new force, for turning from him with a strange, unearthly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
glare on her face, she fixed her glances on the
jury and went steadily on.</p>

<p>"I have said," she began, "that Mrs. Clemmens was
winding her clock. When I came in she stepped down,
and a short and angry colloquy commenced between us.
She did not like my coming there. She did not appreciate
my interest in her nephew. She made me furious,
frenzied, mad. I&mdash;I turned away&mdash;then I came back.
She was standing with her face lifted toward her clock, as
though she no longer heeded or remembered my presence.
I&mdash;I don't know what came to me; whether it
was hatred or love that maddened my brain&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She did not finish; she did not need to. The look she
gave, the attitude she took, the appalling gesture which
she made, supplied the place of language. In an instant
Mr. Ferris, Mr. Orcutt, all the many and confused spectators
who hung upon her words as if spell-bound, realized
that instead of giving evidence inculpating the prisoner,
she was giving evidence <i>accusing</i> herself; that, in other
words, Imogene Dare, goaded to madness by the fearful
alternative of either destroying her lover or sacrificing
herself, had yielded to the claims of her love or her conscience,
and in hearing of judge and jury, proclaimed
herself to be the murderess of Mrs. Clemmens.</p>

<p>The moment that followed was frightful. The prisoner,
who was probably the only man present who foresaw her
intention when she began to speak, had sunk back into
his seat and covered his face with his hands long before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
she reached the fatal declaration. But the spectacle presented
by Mr. Orcutt was enough, as with eyes dilated
and lips half parted in consternation, he stood before
them a victim of overwhelming emotion; so overcome,
indeed, as scarcely to be able to give vent to the one low
and memorable cry that involuntarily left his lips as the
full realization of what she had done smote home to his
stricken breast.</p>

<p>As for Mr. Ferris, he stood dumb, absolutely robbed of
speech by this ghastly confession he had unwillingly
called from his witness' lips; while slowly from end to
end of that court-room the wave of horror spread, till
Imogene, her cause, and that of the wretched prisoner
himself, seemed swallowed up in one fearful tide of unreality
and nightmare.</p>

<p>The first gleam of relief came from the Judge.</p>

<p>"Miss Dare," said he, in his slow, kindly way that
nothing could impair, "do you realize the nature of the
evidence you have given to the court?"</p>

<p>Her slowly falling head and white face, from which all
the fearful excitement was slowly ebbing in a dead despair,
gave answer for her.</p>

<p>"I fear that you are not in a condition to realize the
effect of your words," the Judge went on. "Sympathy for
the prisoner or the excitement of being recalled to the
stand has unnerved or confused you. Take time, Miss
Dare, the court will wait; reconsider your words, and
then tell us the truth about this matter."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span></p>

<p>But Imogene, with white lips and drooped head,
answered hurriedly:</p>

<p>"I have nothing to consider. I have told, or attempted
to tell, how Mrs. Clemmens came to her death. She
was struck down by me; Craik Mansell there is innocent."</p>

<p>At this repetition in words of what she had before
merely intimated by a gesture, the Judge ceased his questions,
and the horror of the multitude found vent in one
long, low, but irrepressible murmur. Taking advantage
of the momentary disturbance, Byrd turned to his colleague
with the agitated inquiry:</p>

<p>"Hickory, is <i>this</i> what you have had in your mind for
the last few days?"</p>

<p>"This," repeated the other, with an air of careful consideration,
assumed, as Byrd thought, to conceal any
emotion which he might have felt; "no, no, not really.
I&mdash;I don't know what I thought. Not this though." And
he fixed his eyes upon Imogene's fallen countenance,
with an expression of mingled doubt and wonder, as
baffling in its nature as the tone of voice he had used.</p>

<p>"But," stammered Byrd, with an earnestness that almost
partook of the nature of pleading, "she is not
speaking the truth, of course. What we heard her say
in the hut&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush!" interposed the other, with a significant gesture
and a sudden glance toward the prisoner and his
counsel; "watching is better than talking just now.
Besides, Orcutt is going to speak."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span></p>

<p>It was so. After a short and violent conflict with the
almost overwhelming emotions that had crushed upon
him with the words and actions of Imogene, the great
lawyer had summoned up sufficient control over himself
to reassume the duties of his position and face once more
the expectant crowd, and the startled, if not thoroughly
benumbed, jury.</p>

<p>His first words had the well-known ring, and, like a
puff of cool air through a heated atmosphere, at once restored
the court-room to its usual condition of formality
and restraint.</p>

<p>"This is not evidence, but the raving of frenzy," he
said, in impassioned tones. "The witness has been tortured
by the demands of the prosecution, till she is no
longer responsible for her words." And turning toward
the District Attorney, who, at the first sound of his adversary's
voice, had roused himself from the stupor into
which he had been thrown by the fearful and unexpected
turn which Imogene's confession had taken, he continued:
"If my learned friend is not lost to all feelings
of humanity, he will withdraw from the stand a witness
laboring under a mental aberration of so serious a
nature."</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris was an irritable man, but he was touched
with sympathy for his friend, reeling under so heavy a
blow. He therefore forbore to notice this taunt save by
a low bow, but turned at once to the Judge.</p>

<p>"Your Honor," said he, "I desire to be understood by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
the Court, that the statement which has just been made
in your hearing by this witness, is as much of a surprise
to me as to any one in this court-room. The fact which
I proposed to elicit from her testimony was of an entirely
different nature. In the conversation which we held last
night&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Mr. Orcutt, vacillating between his powerful concern
for Imogene, and his duty to his client, would not
allow the other to proceed.</p>

<p>"I object," said he, "to any attempt at influencing
the jury by the statement of any conversation which may
have passed between the District Attorney and the witness.
From its effects we may judge something of its
nature, but with its details we have nothing to do."</p>

<p>And raising his voice till it filled the room like a clarion,
Mr. Orcutt said:</p>

<p>"The moment is too serious for wrangling. A spectacle,
the most terrible that can be presented to the eyes
of man, is before you. A young, beautiful, and hitherto
honored woman, caught in the jaws of a cruel fate and
urged on by the emotions of her sex, which turn ever
toward self-sacrifice, has, in a moment of mistaken zeal
or frantic terror, allowed herself to utter words which
sound like a criminal confession. May it please your
Honor and Gentlemen of the Jury, this is an act to awaken
compassion in the breast of every true man. Neither my
client nor myself can regard it in any other light. Though
his case were ten times more critical than it is, and condemnation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
awaited him at your hands instead of a triumphant
acquittal, he is not the man I believe him, if he
would consent to accept a deliverance founded upon
utterances so manifestly frenzied and devoid of truth.
I therefore repeat the objection I have before urged. I
ask your Honor now to strike out all this testimony as
irrelevant in rebuttal, and I beg our learned friend to
close an examination as unprofitable to his own cause as to
mine."</p>

<p>"I agree with my friend," returned Mr. Ferris, "that
the moment is one unfit for controversy. If it please the
Court, therefore, I will withdraw the witness, though by
so doing I am forced to yield all hope of eliciting the important
fact I had relied upon to rebut the defence."</p>

<p>And obedient to the bow of acquiescence he received
from the Judge, the District Attorney turned to Miss
Dare and considerately requested her to leave the stand.</p>

<p>But she, roused by the sound of her name perhaps,
looked up, and meeting the eye of the Judge, said:</p>

<p>"Pardon me, your Honor, but I do not desire to leave
the stand till I have made clear to all who hear me that it
is I, not the prisoner, who am responsible for Mrs. Clemmens'
death. The agony which I have been forced to
undergo in giving testimony against him, has earned me
the right to say the words that prove his innocence and
my own guilt."</p>

<p>"But," said the Judge, "we do not consider you in any
condition to give testimony in court to-day, even against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
yourself. If what you say is true, you shall have ample
opportunities hereafter to confirm and establish your
statements, for you must know, Miss Dare, that no confession
of this nature will be considered sufficient without
testimony corroborative of its truth."</p>

<p>"But, your Honor," she returned, with a dreadful calmness,
"I have corroborative testimony." And amid the
startled looks of all present, she raised her hand and
pointed with steady forefinger at the astounded and by-no-means
gratified Hickory. "Let that man be recalled,"
she cried, "and asked to repeat the conversation he had
with a young servant-girl called Roxana, in Professor
Darling's observatory some ten weeks ago."</p>

<p>The suddenness of her action, the calm assurance with
which it was made, together with the intention it evinced
of summoning actual evidence to substantiate her confession,
almost took away the breath of the assembled
multitude. Even Mr. Orcutt seemed shaken by it, and
stood looking from the outstretched hand of this woman
he so adored, to the abashed countenance of the rough
detective, with a wonder that for the first time betrayed
the presence of alarm. Indeed, to him as to others, the
moment was fuller of horror than when she made her first
self-accusation, for what at that time partook of the
vagueness of a dream, seemed to be acquiring the substance
of an awful reality.</p>

<p>Imogene alone remained unmoved. Still with her eyes
fixed on Hickory, she continued:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span></p>

<p>"He has not told you all he knows about this matter,
any more than I. If my word needs corroboration, look
to him."</p>

<p>And taking advantage of the sensation which this last
appeal occasioned, she waited where she was for the
Judge to speak, with all the calmness of one who has
nothing more to fear or hope for in this world.</p>

<p>But the Judge sat aghast at this spectacle of youth and
beauty insisting upon its own guilt, and neither Mr. Ferris
nor Mr. Orcutt having words for this emergency, a
silence, deep as the feeling which had been aroused,
gradually settled over the whole court. It was fast becoming
oppressive, when suddenly a voice, low but firm,
and endowed with a strange power to awake and hold the
attention, was heard speaking in that quarter of the room
whence Mr. Orcutt's commanding tones had so often
issued. It was an unknown voice, and for a minute a
doubt seemed to rest upon the assembled crowd as to
whom it belonged.</p>

<p>But the change that had come into Imogene's face, as
well as the character of the words that were uttered, soon
convinced them it was the prisoner himself. With a start,
every one turned in the direction of the dock. The
sight that met their eyes seemed a fit culmination of the
scene through which they had just passed. Erect, noble,
as commanding in appearance and address as the woman
who still held her place on the witness stand, Craik Mansell
faced the judge and jury with a quiet, resolute, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
courteous assurance, that seemed at once to rob him of
the character of a criminal, and set him on a par with the
able and honorable men by whom he was surrounded.
Yet his words were not those of a belied man, nor was
his plea one of innocence.</p>

<p>"I ask pardon," he was saying, "for addressing the
court directly; first of all, the pardon of my counsel,
whose ability has never been so conspicuous as in this
case, and whose just resentment, if he were less magnanimous
and noble, I feel I am now about to incur."</p>

<p>Mr. Orcutt turned to him a look of surprise and
severity, but the prisoner saw nothing but the face of
the Judge, and continued:</p>

<p>"I would have remained silent if the disposition which
your Honor and the District Attorney proposed to make
of this last testimony were not in danger of reconsideration
from the appeal which the witness has just made.
I believe, with you, that her testimony should be disregarded.
I intend, if I have the power, that it shall be
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'disegarded'">disregarded</ins>."</p>

<p>The Judge held up his hand, as if to warn the prisoner
and was about to speak.</p>

<p>"I entreat that I may be heard," said Mansell, with
the utmost calmness. "I beg the Court not to imagine
that I am about to imitate the witness in any sudden or
ill-considered attempt at a confession. All I intend is
that her self-accusation shall not derive strength or
importance from any doubts of my guilt which may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
spring from the defence which has been interposed in
my behalf."</p>

<p>Mr. Orcutt, who, from the moment the prisoner began
to speak, had given evidences of a great indecision as to
whether he should allow his client to continue or not,
started at these words, so unmistakably pointing toward
a demolishment of his whole case, and hurriedly rose.
But a glance at Imogene seemed to awaken a new train
of thought, and he as hurriedly reseated himself.</p>

<p>The prisoner, seeing he had nothing to fear from his
counsel's interference, and meeting with no rebuke from
the Judge, went calmly on:</p>

<p>"Yesterday I felt differently in regard to this matter.
If I could be saved from my fate by a defence seemingly
so impregnable, I was willing to be so saved, but to-day
I would be a coward and a disgrace to my sex if, in face
of the generous action of this woman, I allowed a falsehood
of whatever description to place her in peril, or to
stand between me and the doom that probably awaits
me. Sir," he continued, turning for the first time to
Mr. Orcutt, with a gesture of profound respect, "you
had been told that the path from Mrs. Clemmens' house
to the bridge, and so on to Monteith Quarry Station,
could not be traversed in ninety minutes, and you believed
it. You were not wrong. It cannot be gone over
in that time. But I now say to your Honor and to the
jury, that the distance from my aunt's house to the
Quarry Station can be made in that number of minutes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
if a way can be found to cross the river without going
around by the bridge. I know," he proceeded, as a
torrent of muttered exclamations rose on his ear, foremost
among which was that of the much-discomfited
Hickory, "that to many of you, to all of you, perhaps,
all means for doing this seem to be lacking to the chance
wayfarer, but if there were a lumberman here, he would
tell you that the logs which are frequently floated down
this stream to the station afford an easy means of passage
to one accustomed to ride them, as I have been
when a lad, during the year I spent in the Maine woods.
At all events, it was upon a log that happened to be
lodged against the banks, and which I pushed out into
the stream by means of the 'pivy' or long spiked pole
which I found lying in the grass at its side, that I crossed
the river on that fatal day; and if the detective, who has
already made such an effort to controvert the defence,
will risk an attempt at this expedient for cutting short
his route, I have no doubt he will be able to show
you that a man can pass from Mrs. Clemmens' house
to the station at Monteith Quarry, not only in ninety
minutes, but in less, if the exigencies of the case seem to
demand it. I did it."</p>

<p>And without a glance at Imogene, but with an air
almost lofty in its pride and manly assertion, the prisoner
sank back into his seat, and resumed once more his quiet
and unshaken demeanor.</p>

<p>This last change in the kaleidoscope of events, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
had been shifting before their eyes for the last half
hour, was too much for the continued equanimity of
a crowd already worked up into a state of feverish
excitement. It had become apparent that by stripping
away his defence, Mansell left himself naked to the law.
In this excitement of the jury, consequent upon the
self-accusation of Imogene, the prisoner's admission
might prove directly fatal to him. He was on trial
for this crime; public justice demanded blood for
blood, and public excitement clamored for a victim.
It was dangerous to toy with a feeling but one degree
removed from the sentiment of a mob. The jury might
not stop to sympathize with the self-abnegation of these
two persons willing to die for each other. They might
say: "The way is clear as to the prisoner at least; he
has confessed his defence is false; the guilty interpose
false defences; we are acquit before God and men if we
convict him out of his own mouth."</p>

<p>The crowd in the court-room was saying all this and
more, each man to his neighbor. A clamor of voices
next to impossible to suppress rose over the whole room,
and not even the efforts of the officers of the court,
exerted to their full power in the maintenance of order,
could have hushed the storm, had not the spectators
become mute with expectation at seeing Mr. Ferris and
Mr. Orcutt, summoned by a sign from the Judge, advance
to the front of the bench and engage in an earnest conference
with the Court. A few minutes afterward the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
Judge turned to the jury and announced that the disclosures
of the morning demanded a careful consideration
by the prosecution, that an adjournment was undoubtedly
indispensable, and that the jury should refrain from any
discussion of the case, even among themselves, until it was
finally given them under the charge of the Court. The
jury expressed their concurrence by an almost unanimous
gesture of assent, and the crier proclaimed an adjournment
until the next day at ten o'clock.</p>

<p>Imogene, still sitting in the witness chair, saw the
prisoner led forth by the jailer without being able to
gather, in the whirl of the moment, any indication that her
dreadful sacrifice&mdash;for she had made wreck of her life in
the eyes of the world whether her confession were true or
false&mdash;had accomplished any thing save to drive the man
she loved to the verge of that doom from which she had
sought to deliver him.</p>

<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>SHORTLY after the adjournment of court, Mr.
Ferris summoned the two detectives to his office.</div>

<p>"We have a serious question before us to decide," said
he. "Are we to go on with the prosecution or are we to
stop? I should like to hear your views on the subject."</p>

<p>Hickory was, as usual, the first to speak.</p>

<p>"I should say, stop," he cried. "This fresh applicant
for the honor of having slain the Widow Clemmens
deserves a hearing at least."</p>

<p>"But," hurriedly interposed Byrd, "you don't give any
credit to her story now, even if you did before the
prisoner spoke? You know she did not commit the crime
herself, whatever she may choose to declare in her
anxiety to shield the prisoner. I hope, sir," he proceeded,
glancing at the District Attorney, "that <i>you</i> have
no doubts as to Miss Dare's innocence?"</p>

<p>But Mr. Ferris, instead of answering, turned to Hickory
and said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span></p>

<p>"Miss Dare, in summoning you to confirm her statement,
relied, I suppose, upon the fact of your having
been told by Professor Darling's servant-maid that she&mdash;that
is, Miss Dare&mdash;was gone from the observatory when
the girl came for her on the morning of the murder?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"A strong corroborative fact, if true?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"But is it true? In the explanation which Miss Dare
gave me last night of this affair, she uttered statements
essentially different from those she made in court to-day.
She then told me she <i>was</i> in the observatory when the
girl came for her; that she was looking through a telescope
which was behind a high rack filled with charts;
and that&mdash;&mdash; Why do you start?"</p>

<p>"I didn't start," protested Hickory.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," returned Mr. Ferris.</p>

<p>"Well, then, if I did make such a fool of myself, it was
because so far her story is plausible enough. She was in
that very position when <i>I</i> visited the observatory, you
remember, and she was so effectually concealed I didn't
see her or know she was there, till I looked behind the
rack."</p>

<p>"Very good!" interjected Mr. Ferris. "And that,"
he resumed, "she did not answer the girl or make known
her presence, because at the moment the girl came in she
was deeply interested in watching something that was
going on in the town."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span></p>

<p>"In the town!" repeated Byrd.</p>

<p>"Yes; the telescope was lowered so as to command a
view of the town, and she had taken advantage of its
position (as she assured me last night) to consult the
church clock."</p>

<p>"The church clock!" echoed Byrd once more. "And
what time did she say it was?" breathlessly cried both
detectives.</p>

<p>"Five minutes to twelve."</p>

<p>"A critical moment," ejaculated Byrd. "And what
was it she saw going on in the town at that especial
time?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you," returned the District Attorney, impressively.
"She said&mdash;and I believed her last night and
so recalled her to the stand this morning&mdash;that she saw
Craik Mansell fleeing toward the swamp from Mrs.
Clemmens' dining-room door."</p>

<p>Both men looked up astonished.</p>

<p>"That was what she told me last night. To-day she
comes into court with this contradictory story of herself
being the assailant and sole cause of Mrs. Clemmens'
death."</p>

<p>"But all that is frenzy," protested Byrd. "She probably
saw from your manner that the prisoner was lost if
she gave this fact to the court, and her mind became disordered.
She evidently loves this Mansell, and as for
me, I pity her."</p>

<p>"So do I," assented the District Attorney; "still&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is it possible," Byrd interrupted, with feeling, as Mr.
Ferris hesitated, "that you do doubt her innocence?
After the acknowledgments made by the prisoner too?"</p>

<p>Rising from his seat, Mr. Ferris began slowly to pace
the floor.</p>

<p>"I should like each of you," said he, without answering
the appeal of Byrd, "to tell me why I should credit
what she told me in conversation last night rather than
what she uttered upon oath in the court-room to-day?"</p>

<p>"Let me speak first," rejoined Byrd, glancing at Hickory.
And, rising also, he took his stand against the
mantel-shelf where he could partially hide his face from
those he addressed. "Sir," he proceeded, after a moment,
"both Hickory and myself know Miss Dare to be
innocent of this murder. A circumstance which we have
hitherto kept secret, but which in justice to Miss Dare I
think we are now bound to make known, has revealed to
us the true criminal. Hickory, tell Mr. Ferris of the deception
you practised upon Miss Dare in the hut."</p>

<p>The surprised, but secretly gratified, detective at once
complied. <i>He</i> saw no reason for keeping quiet about
that day's work. He told how, by means of a letter purporting
to come from Mansell, he had decoyed Imogene
to an interview in the hut, where, under the supposition
she was addressing her lover, she had betrayed her conviction
of his guilt, and advised him to confess it.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris listened with surprise and great interest.</p>

<p>"That seems to settle the question," he said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span></p>

<p>But it was now Hickory's turn to shake his head.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he remonstrated. "I have sometimes
thought she saw through the trick and turned it to her
own advantage."</p>

<p>"How to her own advantage?"</p>

<p>"To talk in such a way as to make us think Mansell
was guilty."</p>

<p>"Stuff!" said Byrd; "that woman?"</p>

<p>"More unaccountable things have happened," was the
weak reply of Hickory, his habitual state of suspicion
leading him more than once into similar freaks of folly.</p>

<p>"Sir," said Mr. Byrd, confidingly, to the District Attorney,
"let us run over this matter from the beginning.
Starting with the supposition that the explanation she
gave you last night was the true one, let us see if the
whole affair does not hang together in a way to satisfy us
all as to where the real guilt lies. To begin, then, with
the meeting in the woods&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait," interrupted Hickory; "there is going to be an
argument here; so suppose you give your summary of
events from the lady's standpoint, as that seems to be the
one which interests you most."</p>

<p>"I was about to do so," Horace assured him, heedless
of the rough fellow's good-natured taunt. "To make my
point, it is absolutely necessary for us to transfer ourselves
into her position and view matters as they gradually unfolded
themselves before her eyes. First, then, as I have
before suggested, let us consider the interview held by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
this man and woman in the woods. Miss Dare, as we
must remember, was not engaged to Mr. Mansell; she
only loved him. Their engagement, to say nothing of
their marriage, depended upon his success in life&mdash;a success
which to them seemed to hang solely upon the decision
of Mrs. Clemmens concerning the small capital he
desired her to advance him. But in the interview which
Mansell had held with his aunt previous to the meeting
between the lovers, Mrs. Clemmens had refused to loan
him this money, and Miss Dare, whose feelings we are
endeavoring to follow, found herself beset by the entreaties
of a man who, having failed in his plans for future
fortune, feared the loss of her love as well. What was the
natural consequence? Rebellion against the widow's decision,
of course,&mdash;a rebellion which she showed by the
violent gesture which she made;&mdash;and then a determination
to struggle for her happiness, as she evinced when,
with most unhappy ambiguity of expression, she begged
him to wait till the next day before pressing his ring upon
her acceptance, because, as she said:</p>

<p>"'A night has been known to change the whole current
of a person's affairs.'</p>

<p>"To her, engrossed with the one idea of making a personal
effort to alter Mrs. Clemmens' mind on the money
question, these words seemed innocent enough. But the
look with which he received them, and the pause that
followed, undoubtedly impressed her, and prepared the
way for the interest she manifested when, upon looking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
through the telescope the next day, she saw him flying in
that extraordinary way from his aunt's cottage toward the
woods. Not that she then thought of his having committed
a crime. As I trace her mental experience, she
did not come to that conclusion till it was forced upon
her. I do not know, and so cannot say, how she first
heard of the murder&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She was told of it on the street-corner," interpolated
Mr. Ferris.</p>

<p>"Ah, well, then, fresh from this vision of her lover
hasting from his aunt's door to hide himself in the woods
beyond, she came into town and was greeted by the announcement
that Mrs. Clemmens had just been assaulted
by a tramp in her own house. I know this was the way
in which the news was told her, from the expression of
her face as she entered the house. I was standing at the
gate, you remember, when she came up, and her look had
in it determination and horror, but no special fear. In
fact, the words she dropped show the character of her
thoughts at that time. She distinctly murmured in my
hearing: 'No good can come of it, none.' As if her mind
were dwelling upon the advantages which might accrue to
her lover from his aunt's death, and weighing them
against the foul means by which that person's end had
been hastened. Yet I will not say but she may have been
influenced in the course which she took by some doubt or
apprehension of her own. The fact that she came to the
house at all, and, having come, insisted upon knowing all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
the details of the assault, seem to prove she was not without
a desire to satisfy herself that suspicion rightfully
attached itself to the tramp. But not until she saw her
lover's ring on the floor (the ring which she had with her
own hand dropped into the pocket of his coat the day
before) and heard that the tramp had justified himself
and was no longer considered the assailant, did her true
fear and horror come. Then, indeed, all the past rose up
before her, and, believing her lover guilty of this crime,
she laid claim to the jewel as the first and only alternative
that offered by which she might stand between him
and the consequences of his guilt. Her subsequent agitation
when the dying woman made use of the exclamation
that indissolubly connected the crime with a ring, speaks
for itself. Nor was her departure from the house any too
hurried or involuntary, when you consider that the vengeance
invoked by the widow, was, in Miss Dare's opinion,
called down upon one to whom she had nearly
plighted her troth. What is the next act in the drama?
The scene in the Syracuse depot. Let me see if I cannot
explain it. A woman who has once allowed herself to
suspect the man she loves of a murderous deed, cannot
rest till she has either convinced herself that her suspicions
are false, or until she has gained such knowledge of
the truth as makes her feel justified in her seeming treason.
A woman of Miss Dare's generous nature especially.
What does she do, then? With the courage that characterizes
all her movements, she determines upon seeing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
him, and from his own lips, perhaps, win a confession of
guilt or innocence. Conceiving that his flight was directed
toward the Quarry Station, and thence to Buffalo, she
embraced the first opportunity to follow him to the latter
place. As I have told you, her ticket was bought for
Buffalo, and to Buffalo she evidently intended going.
But chancing to leave the cars at Syracuse, she was
startled by encountering in the depot the very man
with whom she had been associating thoughts of guilt.
Shocked and thrown off her guard by the unexpectedness
of the occurrence, she betrays her shrinking and her
horror. 'Were you coming to see me?' she asks, and
recoils, while he, conscious at the first glimpse of her face
that his guilt has cost him her love, starts back also,
uttering, in his shame and despair, words that were similar
to hers, 'Were you coming to see me?'"</p>

<p>"Convinced without further speech, that her worst
fears had foundation in fact, she turns back toward her
home. The man she loved had committed a crime. That
it was partly for her sake only increased her horror
sevenfold. She felt as if she were guilty also, and, with
sudden remorse, remembered how, instead of curbing his
wrath the day before she had inflamed it by her words,
if not given direction to it by her violent gestures. That
fact, and the self-blame it produced, probably is the cause
why her love did not vanish with her hopes. Though he
was stained by guilt, she felt that it was the guilt of a
strong nature driven from its bearings by the conjunction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
of two violent passions,&mdash;ambition and love; and she
being passionate and ambitious herself, remained attached
to the man while she recoiled from his crime.</p>

<p>"This being so, she could not, as a woman, wish him
to suffer the penalty of his wickedness. Though lost to
her, he must not be lost to the world. So, with the
heroism natural to such a nature, she shut the secret up
in her own breast, and faced her friends with courage,
wishing, if not hoping, that the matter would remain the
mystery it promised to be when she stood with us in the
presence of the dying woman.</p>

<p>"But this was not to be, for suddenly, in the midst of
her complacency, fell the startling announcement that
another man&mdash;an innocent man&mdash;one, too, of her lover's
own standing, if not hopes, had by a curious conjunction
of events so laid himself open to the suspicion of the
authorities as to be actually under arrest for this crime.
'Twas a danger she had not foreseen, a result for which
she was not prepared.</p>

<p>"Startled and confounded she let a few days go by in
struggle and indecision, possibly hoping, with the blind
trust of her sex, that Mr. Hildreth would be released
without her interference. But Mr. Hildreth was not released,
and her anxiety was fast becoming unendurable,
when that decoy letter sent by Hickory reached her,
awakening in her breast for the first time, perhaps, the
hope that Mansell would show himself to be a true man
in this extremity, and by a public confession of guilt release<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
her from the task of herself supplying the information
which would lead to his commitment.</p>

<p>"And, perhaps, if it had really fallen to the lot of
Mansell to confront her in the hut and listen to her
words of adjuration and appeal, he might have been induced
to consent to her wishes. But a detective sat
there instead of her lover, and the poor woman lived to
see the days go by without any movement being made to
save Mr. Hildreth. At last&mdash;was it the result of the
attempt made by this man upon his life?&mdash;she put an end
to the struggle by acting for herself. Moved by a sense
of duty, despite her love, she sent the letter which drew
attention to her lover, and paved the way for that trial
which has occupied our attention for so many days. But&mdash;mark
this, for I think it is the only explanation of her
whole conduct&mdash;the sense of justice that upheld her in this
duty was mingled with the hope that her lover would
escape conviction if he did not trial. The one fact
which told the most against him&mdash;I allude to his flight
from his aunt's door on the morning of the murder, as
observed by her through the telescope&mdash;was as yet a
secret in her own breast, and there she meant it to
remain unless it was drawn forth by actual question. But
it was not a fact likely to be made the subject of question,
and drawing hope from that consideration, she prepared
herself for the ordeal before her, determined, as I
actually believe, to answer with truth all the inquiries
that were put to her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span></p>

<p>"But in an unexpected hour she learned that the detectives
were anxious to know where she was during the
time of the murder. She heard Hickory question Professor
Darling's servant-girl, as to whether she was still
in the observatory, and at once feared that her secret was
discovered. Feared, I say&mdash;I conjecture this,&mdash;but what
I do not conjecture is that with the fear, or doubt, or
whatever emotion it was she cherished, a revelation came
of the story she might tell if worst came to worst, and
she found herself forced to declare what she saw when
the clock stood at five minutes to twelve on that fatal
day. Think of your conversation with the girl Roxana,"
he went on to Hickory, "and then think of that woman
crouching behind the rack, listening to your words, and
see if you can draw any other conclusion from the expression
of her face than that of triumph at seeing a way
to deliver her lover at the sacrifice of herself."</p>

<p>As Byrd waited for a reply, Hickory reluctantly acknowledged:</p>

<p>"Her look was a puzzler, that I will allow. She seemed
glad&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There," cried Byrd, "you say she seemed glad; that
is enough. Had she had the weight of this crime upon
her conscience, she would have betrayed a different emotion
from that. I pray you to consider the situation,"
he proceeded, turning to the District Attorney, "for on
it hangs your conviction of her innocence. First, imagine
her guilty. What would her feelings be, as, hiding unseen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
in that secret corner, she hears a detective's voice inquiring
where she was when the fatal blow was struck, and
hears the answer given that she was not where she was
supposed to be, but in the woods&mdash;the woods which she
and every one know lead so directly to Mrs. Clemmens'
house, she could without the least difficulty hasten there
and back in the hour she was observed to be missing?
Would she show gladness or triumph even of a wild or
delirious order? No, even Hickory cannot say she
would. Now, on the contrary, see her as I do, crouched
there in the very place before the telescope which she
occupied when the girl came to the observatory before,
but unseen now as she was unseen then, and watch the
change that takes place in her countenance as she hears
question and answer and realizes what confirmation she
would receive from this girl if she ever thought fit to declare
that she was not in the observatory when the girl
sought her there on the day of the murder. That by this
act she would bring execration if not death upon herself,
she does not stop to consider. Her mind is full of what
she can do for her lover, and she does not think of herself.</p>

<p>"But an enthusiasm like this is too frenzied to last.
As time passes by and Craik Mansell is brought to trial,
she begins to hope she may be spared this sacrifice. She
therefore responds with perfect truth when summoned to
the stand to give evidence, and does not waver, though
question after question is asked her, whose answers cannot
fail to show the state of her mind in regard to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
prisoner's guilt. Life and honor are sweet even to one
in her condition; and if her lover could be saved without
falsehood it was her natural instinct to avoid it.</p>

<p>"And it looked as if he would be saved. A defence
both skilful and ingenious had been advanced for him by
his counsel&mdash;a defence which only the one fact so securely
locked in her bosom could controvert. You can imagine,
then, the horror and alarm which must have seized her
when, in the very hour of hope, you approached her with
the demand which proved that her confidence in her
power to keep silence had been premature, and that the
alternative was yet to be submitted to her of destroying
her lover or sacrificing herself. Yet, because a great
nature does not succumb without a struggle, she tried even
now the effect of the truth upon you, and told you the one
fact she considered so detrimental to the safety of her
lover.</p>

<p>"The result was fatal. Though I cannot presume to
say what passed between you, I can imagine how the
change in your countenance warned her of the doom she
would bring upon Mansell if she went into court with the
same story she told you. Nor do I find it difficult to
imagine how, in one of her history and temperament, a
night of continuous brooding over this one topic should
have culminated in the act which startled us so profoundly
in the court-room this morning. Love, misery, devotion
are not mere names to her, and the greatness which sustained
her through the ordeal of denouncing her lover in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
order that an innocent man might be relieved from suspicion,
was the same that made it possible for her to
denounce herself that she might redeem the life she had
thus deliberately jeopardized.</p>

<p>"That she did this with a certain calmness and dignity
proves it to have been the result of design. A murderess
forced by conscience into confession would not have gone
into the details of her crime, but blurted out her guilt,
and left the details to be drawn from her by question.
Only the woman anxious to tell her story with the plausibility
necessary to insure its belief would have planned
and carried on her confession as she did.</p>

<p>"The action of the prisoner, in face of this proof of
devotion, though it might have been foreseen by a man,
was evidently not foreseen by her. To me, who watched
her closely at the time, her face wore a strange look of
mingled satisfaction and despair,&mdash;satisfaction in having
awakened his manhood, despair at having failed in saving
him. But it is not necessary for me to dilate on this
point. If I have been successful in presenting before you
the true condition of her mind during this struggle, you
will see for yourself what her feelings must be now that
her lover has himself confessed to a fact, to hide which
she made the greatest sacrifice of which mortal is capable."</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris, who, during this lengthy and exhaustive
harangue, had sat with brooding countenance and an
anxious mien, roused himself as the other ceased, and
glanced with a smile at Hickory.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," said he, "that's good reasoning; now let us
hear how you will go to work to demolish it."</p>

<p>The cleared brow, the playful tone of the District
Attorney showed the relieved state of his mind. Byrd's
arguments had evidently convinced him of the innocence
of Imogene Dare.</p>

<p>Hickory, seeing it, shook his head with a gloomy air.</p>

<p>"Sir," said he, "I can't demolish it. If I could tell
why Mansell fled from Widow Clemmens' house at five
minutes to twelve I might be able to do so, but that fact
stumps me. It is an act consistent with guilt. It may
be consistent with innocence, but, as we don't know all
the facts, we can't say so. But this I do know, that my
convictions with regard to that man have undergone a
change. I now as firmly believe in his innocence as
I once did in his guilt."</p>

<p>"What has produced the change?" asked Mr. Ferris.</p>

<p>"Well," said Hickory, "it all lies in this. From the
day I heard Miss Dare accuse him so confidently in the
hut, I believed him guilty; from the moment he withdrew
his defence, I believed him innocent."</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris and Mr. Byrd looked at him astonished.
He at once brought down his fist in vigorous assertion on
the table.</p>

<p>"I tell you," said he, "that Craik Mansell is innocent.
The truth is, he believes Miss Dare guilty, and so stands
his trial, hoping to save her."</p>

<p>"And be hung for her crime?" asked Mr. Ferris.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span></p>

<p>"No; he thinks his innocence will save him, in spite
of the evidence on which we got him indicted."</p>

<p>But the District Attorney protested at this.</p>

<p>"That can't be," said he; "Mansell has withdrawn the
only defence he had."</p>

<p>"On the contrary," asserted Hickory, "that very thing
only proves my theory true. He is still determined to
save Miss Dare by every thing short of a confession
of his own guilt. He won't lie. That man is innocent."</p>

<p>"And Miss Dare is guilty?" said Byrd.</p>

<p>"Shall I make it clear to you in the way it has become
clear to Mr. Mansell?"</p>

<p>As Byrd only answered by a toss of his head,
Hickory put his elbows on the table, and checking off
every sentence with the forefinger of his right hand,
which he pointed at Mr. Ferris' shirt-stud, as if to instil
from its point conviction into that gentleman's bosom, he
proceeded with the utmost composure as follows:</p>

<p>"To commence, then, with the scene in the woods.
He meets her. She is as angry at his aunt as he is.
What does she do? She strikes the tree with her hand,
and tells him to wait till to-morrow, since a night has
been known to change the whole current of a person's
affairs. Now tell me what does that mean? Murder?
If so, she was the one to originate it. He can't forget
that. It has stamped itself upon Mansell's memory, and
when, after the assassination of Mrs. Clemmens, he recalls
those words, he is convinced that she has slain Mrs.
Clemmens to help him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, Mr. Hickory," objected Mr. Ferris, "this assumes
that Mr. Mansell is innocent, whereas we have
exceedingly cogent proof that he is the guilty party.
There is the circumstance of his leaving Widow Clemmens'
house at five minutes to twelve."</p>

<p>To which Hickory, with a twinkle in his eye, replied:</p>

<p>"I won't discuss that; it hasn't been proved, you
know. Miss Dare told you she saw him do this, but she
wouldn't swear to it. Nothing is to be taken for granted
against my man."</p>

<p>"Then you think Miss Dare spoke falsely?"</p>

<p>"I don't say that. I believe that whatever he did
could be explained if we knew as much about it as
he does. But I'm not called upon to explain any
thing which has not appeared in the evidence against
him."</p>

<p>"Well, then, we'll take the evidence. There is his
ring, found on the scene of murder."</p>

<p>"Exactly," rejoined Hickory. "Dropped there, as he
must suppose, by Miss Dare, because he didn't know she
had secretly restored it to his pocket."</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris smiled.</p>

<p>"You don't see the force of the evidence," said he.
"As she <i>had</i> restored it to his pocket, he must have been
the one to drop it there."</p>

<p>"I am willing to admit he dropped it there, not that
he killed Mrs. Clemmens. I am now speaking of his
suspicions as to the assassin. When the betrothal ring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
was found there, he suspects Miss Dare of the crime, and
nothing has occurred to change his suspicions."</p>

<p>"But," said the District Attorney, "how does your
client, Mr. Mansell, get over this difficulty; that Miss
Dare, who has committed a murder to put five thousand
dollars into his pocket, immediately afterward turns
round and accuses him of the crime&mdash;nay more, furnishes
evidence against him!"</p>

<p>"You can't expect the same consistency from a woman
as from a man. They can nerve themselves up one
moment to any deed of desperation, and take every pains
the next to conceal it by a lie."</p>

<p>"Men will do the same; then why not Mansell?"</p>

<p>"I am showing you why I know that Mansell believes
Miss Dare guilty of a murder. To continue, then. What
does he do when he hears that his aunt has been murdered?
He scratches out the face of Miss Dare in a
photograph; he ties up her letters with a black ribbon as
if she were dead and gone to him. Then the scene in
the Syracuse depot! The rule of three works both ways,
Mr. Byrd, and if she left her home to solve <i>her</i> doubts,
what shall be said of him? The recoil, too&mdash;was it less
on his part than hers? And, if she had cause to gather
guilt from his manner, had he not as much cause to
gather it from hers? If his mind was full of suspicion
when he met her, it became conviction before he left;
and, bearing that fact in your mind, watch how he henceforth
conducted himself. He does not come to Sibley;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
the woman he fears to encounter is there. He hears of
Mr. Hildreth's arrest, reads of the discoveries which led
to it, and keeps silent. So would any other man have
done in his place, at least till he saw whether this arrest
was likely to end in trial. But he cannot forget he had
been in Sibley on the fatal day, or that there may be
some one who saw his interview with Miss Dare. When
Byrd comes to him, therefore, and tells him he is wanted
in Sibley, his first question is, 'Am I wanted as a witness?'
and, even you have acknowledged, Mr. Ferris,
that he seemed surprised to find himself accused of the
crime. But, accused, he takes his course and keeps to it.
Brought to trial, he remembers the curious way in which
he crossed the river, and thus cut short the road to the
station; and, seeing in it great opportunities for a successful
defence, chooses Mr. Orcutt for his counsel, and
trusts the secret to him. The trial goes on; acquittal
seems certain, when suddenly she is recalled to the
stand, and he hears words which make him think she is
going to betray him by some falsehood, when, instead of
following the lead of the prosecution, she launches into a
personal confession. What does he do? Why, rise and
hold up his hand in a command for her to stop. But she
does not heed, and the rest follows as a matter of course.
The life she throws away he will not accept. He is
innocent, but his defence is false! He says so, and
leaves the jury to decide on the verdict. There can be
no doubt," Hickory finally concluded, "that some of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
these circumstances are consistent only with his belief
that Miss Dare is a murderess: such, for instance, as his
scratching out her face in the picture. Others favor the
theory in a less degree, but this is what I want to impress
upon both your minds," he declared, turning first to Mr.
Ferris and then to Mr. Byrd: "<i>If any fact, no matter how
slight, leads us to the conviction that Craik Mansell, at any
time after the murder, entertained the belief that Miss Dare
committed it, his innocence follows as a matter of course.
For the guilty could never entertain a belief in the guilt of
any other person.</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Ferris, "I admit that, but we have got
to see into Mr. Mansell's mind before we can tell what
his belief really was."</p>

<p>"No," was Hickory's reply; "let us look at his actions.
I say that that defaced picture is conclusive. One day
he loves that woman and wants her to marry him; the
next, he defaces her picture. Why? She had not offended
him. Not a word, not a line, passes between them to
cause him to commit this act. But he does hear of his
aunt's murder, and he does recall her sinister promise:
'Wait; there is no telling what a day will bring forth.'
I say that no other cause for his act is shown except his
conviction that she is a murderess."</p>

<p>"But," persisted Mr. Ferris, "his leaving the house, as
he acknowledges he did, by this unfrequented and circuitous
road?"</p>

<p>"I have said before that I cannot explain his presence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
there, or his flight. All I am now called upon to show
is, some fact inconsistent with any thing except a belief in
this young woman's guilt. I claim I have shown it, and,
as you admit, Mr. Ferris, if I show <i>that</i>, he is innocent."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Byrd, speaking for the first time; "but we
have heard of people manufacturing evidence in their own
behalf."</p>

<p>"Come, Byrd," replied Hickory, "you don't seriously
mean to attack my position with that suggestion. How
could a man dream of manufacturing evidence of such a
character? A murderer manufactures evidence to throw
suspicion on other people. No fool could suppose that
scratching out the face of a girl in a photograph and locking
it up in his own desk, would tend to bring her to the
scaffold, or save him from it."</p>

<p>"And, yet," rejoined Byrd, "that very act acquits him
in your eyes. All that is necessary is to give him credit
for being smart enough to foresee that it would have such
a tendency in the eyes of any person who discovered the
picture."</p>

<p>"Then," said Hickory, "he would also have to foresee
that she would accuse herself of murder when he was on
trial for it, and that he would thereupon withdraw his
defence. Byrd, you are foreseeing too much. My friend
Mansell possesses no such power of looking into the
future as that."</p>

<p>"Your friend Mansell!" repeated Mr. Ferris, with a
smile. "If you were on his jury, I suppose your bias in
his favor would lead you to acquit him of this crime?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should declare him 'Not guilty,' and stick to it, if I
had to be locked up for a year."</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris sank into an attitude of profound thought.
Horace Byrd, impressed by this, looked at him anxiously.</p>

<p>"Have your convictions been shaken by Hickory's ingenious
theory?" he ventured to inquire at last.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris abstractedly replied:</p>

<p>"This is no time for me to state my convictions. It is
enough that you comprehend my perplexity." And, relapsing
into his former condition, he remained for a
moment wrapped in silence, then he said: "Byrd, how
comes it that the humpback who excited so much attention
on the day of the murder was never found?"</p>

<p>Byrd, astonished, surveyed the District Attorney with a
doubtful look that gradually changed into one of quiet
satisfaction as he realized the significance of this recurrence
to old theories and suspicions. His answer, however,
was slightly embarrassed in tone, though frank
enough to remind one of Hickory's blunt-spoken admissions.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "I suppose the main reason is that I
made no attempt to find him."</p>

<p>"Do you think that you were wise in that, Mr. Byrd?"
inquired Mr. Ferris, with some severity.</p>

<p>Horace laughed.</p>

<p>"I can find him for you to-day, if you want him," he
declared.</p>

<p>"You can? You know him, then?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very well. Mr. Ferris," he courteously remarked,
"I perhaps should have explained to you at the time,
that I recognized this person and knew him to be an
honest man; but the habits of secrecy in our profession
are so fostered by the lives we lead, that we sometimes
hold our tongue when it would be better for us to speak.
The humpback who talked with us on the court-house
steps the morning Mrs. Clemmens was murdered, was not
what he seemed, sir. He was a detective; a detective in
disguise; a man with whom I never presume to meddle&mdash;in
other words, our famous Mr. Gryce."</p>

<p>"Gryce!&mdash;that man!" exclaimed Mr. Ferris, astounded.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. He was in disguise, probably for some
purpose of his own, but I knew his eye. Gryce's eye
isn't to be mistaken by any one who has much to
do with him."</p>

<p>"And that famous detective was actually on the spot
at the time this murder was discovered, and you let him
go without warning me of his presence?"</p>

<p>"Sir," returned Mr. Byrd, "neither you nor I nor any
one at that time could foresee what a serious and complicated
case this was going to be. Besides, he did not linger
in this vicinity, but took the cars only a few minutes after
he parted from us. I did not think he wanted to be
dragged into this affair unless it was necessary. He had
important matters of his own to look after. However, if
suspicion had continued to follow him, I should have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
notified him of the fact, and let him speak for himself.
But it vanished so quickly in the light of other developments,
I just let the matter drop."</p>

<p>The impatient frown with which Mr. Ferris received
this acknowledgment showed he was not pleased.</p>

<p>"I think you made a mistake," said he. Then, after
a minute's thought, added: "You have seen Gryce
since?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; several times."</p>

<p>"And he acknowledged himself to have been the
humpback?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You must have had some conversation with him,
then, about this murder? He was too nearly concerned
in it not to take some interest in the affair?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; Gryce takes an interest in all murder
cases."</p>

<p>"Well, then, what did he have to say about this one?
He gave an opinion, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. Gryce never gives an opinion without
study, and we detectives have no time to study up an
affair not our own. If you want to know what Gryce
thinks about a crime, you have got to put the case into
his hands."</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris paused and seemed to ruminate. Seeing
this, Mr. Byrd flushed and cast a side glance at Hickory,
who returned him an expressive shrug.</p>

<p>"Mr. Ferris," ventured the former, "if you wish to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
consult with Mr. Gryce on this matter, do not hesitate
because of us. Both Hickory and myself acknowledge
we are more or less baffled by this case, and Gryce's
judgment is a good thing to have in a perplexity."</p>

<p>"You think so?" queried the District Attorney.</p>

<p>"I do," said Byrd.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris glanced at Hickory.</p>

<p>"Oh, have the old man here if you want him," was
that detective's blunt reply. "I have nothing to say
against your getting all the light you can on this
affair."</p>

<p>"Very good," returned Mr. Ferris. "You may give
me his address before you go."</p>

<p>"His address for to-night is Utica," observed Byrd.
"He could be here before morning, if you wanted
him."</p>

<p>"I am in no such hurry as that," returned Mr. Ferris,
and he sank again into thought.</p>

<p>The detectives took advantage of his abstraction to
utter a few private condolences in each other's ears.</p>

<p>"So it seems we are to be laid on the shelf," whispered
Hickory.</p>

<p>"Yes, for which let us be thankful," answered Byrd.</p>

<p>"Why? Are you getting tired of the affair?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>A humorous twinkle shone for a minute in Hickory's
eye.</p>

<p>"Pooh!" said he, "it's just getting interesting."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span></p>

<p>"Opinions differ," quoth Byrd.</p>

<p>"Not much," retorted Hickory.</p>

<p>Something in the way he said this made Byrd look
at him more intently. He instantly changed his tone.</p>

<p>"Old fellow," said he, "you don't believe Miss Dare
committed this crime any more than I do."</p>

<p>A sly twinkle answered him from the detective's half-shut
eye.</p>

<p>"All that talk of having seen through your disguise in
the hut is just nonsense on your part to cover up your
real notion about it. What is that notion, Hickory?
Come, out with it; let us understand each other thoroughly
at last."</p>

<p>"Do I understand you?"</p>

<p>"You shall, when you tell me just what your convictions
are in this matter."</p>

<p>"Well, then," replied Hickory, with a short glance at
Mr. Ferris, "I believe (it's hard as pulling teeth to own
it) that neither of them did it: that she thought him
guilty and he thought her so, but that in reality the crime
lies at the door of some third party totally disconnected
with either of them."</p>

<p>"Such as Gouverneur Hildreth?" whispered Byrd.</p>

<p>"<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Sueh'">Such</ins>&mdash;as&mdash;Gouverneur Hildreth," drawled Hickory.</p>

<p>The two detectives eyed each other, smiled, and
turned with relieved countenances toward the District
Attorney. He was looking at them with great earnestness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is your joint opinion?" he remarked.</p>

<p>"It is mine," cried Hickory, bringing his fist down on
the table with a vim that made every individual article on
it jump.</p>

<p>"It is and it is not mine," acquiesced Byrd, as the eye
of Mr. Ferris turned in his direction. "Mr. Mansell
may be innocent&mdash;indeed, after hearing Hickory's explanation
of his conduct, I am ready to believe he is&mdash;but
to say that Gouverneur Hildreth is guilty comes
hard to me after the long struggle I have maintained in
favor of his innocence. Yet, what other conclusion remains
after an impartial view of the subject? None.
Then why should I shrink from acknowledging I was at
fault, or hesitate to admit a defeat where so many causes
combined to mislead me?"</p>

<p>"Which means you agree with Hickory?" ventured
the District Attorney.</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd slowly bowed.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris continued for a moment looking alternately
from one to the other; then he observed:</p>

<p>"When two such men unite in an opinion, it is at least
worthy of consideration." And, rising, he took on an
aspect of sudden determination. "Whatever may be the
truth in regard to this matter," said he, "one duty is
clear. Miss Dare, as you inform me, has been&mdash;with but
little idea of the consequences, I am sure&mdash;allowed to remain
under the impression that the interview which she
held in the hut was with her lover. As her belief in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
prisoner's guilt doubtless rests upon the admissions which
were at that time made in her hearing, it is palpable that
a grave injustice has been done both to her and to him
by leaving this mistake of hers uncorrected. I therefore
consider it due to Miss Dare, as well as to the prisoner,
to undeceive her on this score before another hour has
passed over our heads. I must therefore request you,
Mr. Byrd, to bring the lady here. You will find her still
in the court-house, I think, as she requested leave to
remain in the room below till the crowd had left the
streets."</p>

<p>Mr. Byrd, who, in the new light which had been
thrown on the affair by his own and Hickory's suppositions,
could not but see the justice of this, rose with
alacrity to obey.</p>

<p>"I will bring her if she is in the building," he declared,
hurriedly leaving the room.</p>

<p>"And if she is not," Mr. Ferris remarked, with a glance
at the consciously rebuked Hickory, "we shall have to
follow her to her home, that is all. I am determined to
see this woman's mind cleared of all misapprehensions
before I take another step in the way of my duty.</p>

<h2>XXXVI.</h2>

<h3>A MISTAKE RECTIFIED.</h3>

<div class='poem'>
If circumstances lead me, I will find<br />
Where truth is hid, though it were hid, indeed,<br />
Within the centre.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &mdash;<span class="smcap">Hamlet.</span><br />
<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>IF Mr. Ferris, in seeking this interview with Miss
Dare, had been influenced by any hope of finding
her in an unsettled and hesitating state of mind, he was
effectually undeceived, when, after a few minutes' absence,
Mr. Byrd returned with her to his presence. Though her
physical strength was nearly exhausted, and she looked
quite pale and worn, there was a steady gleam in her eye,
which spoke of an unshaken purpose.</div>

<p>Seeing it, and noting the forced humility with which
she awaited his bidding at the threshold, the District
Attorney, for the first time perhaps, realized the power
of this great, if perverted, nature, and advancing with
real kindness to the door, he greeted her with as much
deference as he ever showed to ladies, and gravely
pushed toward her a chair.</p>

<p>She did not take it. On the contrary, she drew back
a step, and looked at him in some doubt, but a sudden
glimpse of Hickory's sturdy figure in the corner seemed
to reassure her, and merely stopping to acknowledge Mr.
Ferris' courtesy by a bow, she glided forward and took
her stand by the chair he had provided.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span></p>

<p>A short and, on his part, somewhat embarrassing
pause followed. It was broken by her.</p>

<p>"You sent for me," she suggested. "You perhaps
want some explanation of my conduct, or some assurance
that the confession I made before the court to-day was
true?"</p>

<p>If Mr. Ferris had needed any further proof than he had
already received that Imogene Dare, in presenting herself
before the world as a criminal, had been actuated by a
spirit of devotion to the prisoner, he would have found it
in the fervor and unconscious dignity with which she
uttered these few words. But he needed no such proof.
Giving her, therefore, a look full of grave significance, he
replied:</p>

<p>"No, Miss Dare. After my experience of the ease
with which you can contradict yourself in matters of the
most serious import, you will pardon me if I say that the
truth or falsehood of your words must be arrived at by
some other means than any you yourself can offer. My
business with you at this time is of an entirely different
nature. Instead of listening to further confessions from
you, it has become my duty to offer one myself. Not on
my own behalf," he made haste to explain, as she looked
up, startled, "but on account of these men, who, in their
anxiety to find out who murdered Mrs. Clemmens, made
use of means and resorted to deceptions which, if their
superiors had been consulted, would not have been countenanced
for a moment."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do not understand," she murmured, looking at the
two detectives with a wonder that suddenly merged into
alarm as she noticed the embarrassment of the one and
the decided discomfiture of the other.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris at once resumed:</p>

<p>"In the weeks that have elapsed since the commission
of this crime, it has been my lot to subject you to much
mental misery, Miss Dare. Provided by yourself with a
possible clue to the murder, I have probed the matter
with an unsparing hand. Heedless of the pain I was inflicting,
or the desperation to which I was driving you, I
asked you questions and pressed you for facts as long as
there seemed questions to ask or facts to be gained. My
duty and the claims of my position demanded this, and
for it I can make no excuse, notwithstanding the unhappy
results that have ensued. But, Miss Dare, whatever
anxiety I may have shown in procuring the conviction of
a man I believed to be a criminal, I have never wished to
win my case at the expense of justice and right; and had
I been told before you came to the stand that you had
been made the victim of a deception calculated to influence
your judgment, I should have hastened to set you
right with the same anxiety as I do now."</p>

<p>"Sir&mdash;sir&mdash;&mdash;" she began.</p>

<p>But Mr. Ferris would not listen.</p>

<p>"Miss Dare," he proceeded with all the gravity of conviction,
"you have uttered a deliberate perjury in the
court-room to-day. You said that you alone were responsible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
for the murder of Mrs. Clemmens, whereas you
not only did not commit the crime yourself but were not
even an accessory to it. Wait!" he commanded, as she
flashed upon him a look full of denial, "I would rather
you did not speak. The motive for this calumny you uttered
upon yourself lies in a fact which may be modified
by what I have to reveal. Hear me, then, before you
stain yourself still further by a falsehood you will not
only be unable to maintain, but which you may no longer
see reason for insisting upon. Hickory, turn around so
Miss Dare can see your face. Miss Dare, when you saw
fit to call upon this man to upbear you in the extraordinary
statements you made to-day, did you realize that in
doing this you appealed to the one person best qualified
to prove the falsehood of what you had said? I see you
did not; yet it is so. He if no other can testify that a few
weeks ago, no idea of taking this crime upon your own
shoulders had ever crossed your mind; that, on the contrary,
your whole heart was filled with sorrow for the supposed
guilt of another, and plans for inducing that
other to make a confession of his guilt before the
world."</p>

<p>"This man!" was her startled exclamation. "It is
not possible; I do not know him; he does not know me.
I never talked with him but once in my life, and that was
to say words I am not only willing but anxious for him
to repeat."</p>

<p>"Miss Dare," the District Attorney pursued, "when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
you say this you show how completely you have
been deceived. The conversation to which you allude
is not the only one which has passed between you two.
Though you did not know it, you held a talk with
this man at a time in which you so completely discovered
the secrets of your heart, you can never hope
to deceive us or the world by any story of personal
guilt which you may see fit to manufacture."</p>

<p>"I reveal my heart to this man!" she repeated, in
a maze of doubt and terror that left her almost unable
to stand. "You are playing with my misery, Mr.
Ferris."</p>

<p>The District Attorney took a different tone.</p>

<p>"Miss Dare," he asked, "do you remember a certain
interview you held with a gentleman in the hut
back of Mrs. Clemmens' house, a short time after the
murder?"</p>

<p>"Did this man overhear my words that day?" she
murmured, reaching out her hand to steady herself by
the back of the chair near which she was standing.</p>

<p>"Your words that day were addressed to this man."</p>

<p>"To him!" she repeated, staggering back.</p>

<p>"Yes, to him, disguised as Craik Mansell. With an
unjustifiable zeal to know the truth, he had taken this
plan for surprising your secret thoughts, and he succeeded,
Miss Dare, remember that, even if he did you and
your lover the cruel wrong of leaving you undisturbed in
the impression that Mr. Mansell had admitted his guilt in
your presence."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span></p>

<p>But Imogene, throwing out her hands, cried impetuously:</p>

<p>"It is not so; you are mocking me. This man never
could deceive me like that!"</p>

<p>But even as she spoke she recoiled, for Hickory, with
ready art, had thrown his arms and head forward on the
table before which he sat, in the attitude and with much
the same appearance he had preserved on the day she
had come upon him in the hut. Though he had no assistance
from disguise and all the accessories were lacking
which had helped forward the illusion on the former
occasion, there was still a sufficient resemblance between
this bowed figure and the one that had so impressed itself
upon her memory as that of her wretched and remorseful
lover, that she stood rooted to the ground in her surprise
and dismay.</p>

<p>"You see how it was done, do you not?" inquired
Mr. Ferris. Then, as he saw she did not heed, added:
"I hope you remember what passed between you two on
that day?"</p>

<p>As if struck by a thought which altered the whole atmosphere
of her hopes and feelings, she took a step forward
with a power and vigor that recalled to mind the
Imogene of old.</p>

<p>"Sir," she exclaimed, "let that man turn around and
face me!"</p>

<p>Hickory at once rose.</p>

<p>"Tell me," she demanded, surveying him with a look<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
it took all his well-known hardihood to sustain unmoved,
"was it all false&mdash;all a trick from the beginning to the
end? I received a letter&mdash;was that written by your hand
too? Are you capable of forgery as well as of other
deceptions?"</p>

<p>The detective, who knew no other way to escape from
his embarrassment, uttered a short laugh. But finding a
reply was expected of him, answered with well-simulated
indifference:</p>

<p>"No, only the address on the envelope was mine; the
letter was one which Mr. Mansell had written but never
sent. I found it in his waste-paper basket in Buffalo."</p>

<p>"Ah! and you could make use of that?"</p>

<p>"I know it was a mean trick," he acknowledged, dropping
his eyes from her face. "But things do look different
when you are in the thick of 'em than when you
take a stand and observe them from the outside. I&mdash;I
was ashamed of it long ago, Miss Dare"&mdash;this was a lie;
Hickory never was really ashamed of it&mdash;"and would
have told you about it, but I thought 'mum' was the
word after a scene like that."</p>

<p>She did not seem to hear him.</p>

<p>"Then Mr. Mansell did not send me the letter inviting
me to meet him in the hut on a certain day, some few
weeks after Mrs. Clemmens was murdered?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Nor know that such a letter had been sent?"</p>

<p>"No."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nor come, as I supposed he did, to Sibley? nor admit
what I supposed he admitted in my hearing? nor
listen, as I supposed he did, to the insinuations I made
use of in the hut?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Imbued with sudden purpose and energy, she turned
upon the District Attorney.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a revelation to come to me now!" she
murmured.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris bowed.</p>

<p>"You are right," he assented; "it should have come
to you before. But I can only repeat what I have previously
said, that if I had known of this deception myself,
you would have been notified of it previous to going
upon the stand. For your belief in the prisoner's guilt
has necessarily had its effect upon the jury, and I cannot
but see how much that belief must have been strengthened,
if it was not actually induced, by the interview
which we have just been considering."</p>

<p>Her eyes took on fresh light; she looked at Mr. Ferris
as if she would read his soul.</p>

<p>"Can it be possible&mdash;&mdash;" she breathed, but stopped as
suddenly as she began. The District Attorney was not
the man from whom she could hope to obtain any opinion
in reference to the prisoner's innocence.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris, noting her hesitation and understanding it
too, perhaps, moved toward her with a certain kindly dignity,
saying:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should be glad to utter words that would give you
some comfort, Miss Dare, but in the present state of affairs
I do not feel as if I could go farther than bid you
trust in the justice and wisdom of those who have this
matter in charge. As for your own wretched and uncalled-for
action in court to-day, it was a madness which
I hope will be speedily forgotten, or, if not forgotten, laid
to a despair almost too heavy for mortal strength to
endure."</p>

<p>"Thank you," she murmured; but her look, the poise
of her head, the color that quivered through the pallor of
her cheek, showed she was not thinking of herself.
Doubt, the first which had visited her since she became
convinced that Craik Mansell was the destroyer of his
aunt's life, had cast a momentary gleam over her thoughts,
and she was conscious of but one wish, and that was to
understand the feelings of the men before her.</p>

<p>But she soon saw the hopelessness of this, and, sinking
back again into her old distress as she realized how
much reason she still had for believing Craik Mansell
guilty, she threw a hurried look toward the door as if
anxious to escape from the eyes and ears of men interested,
as she knew, in gleaning her every thought and
sounding her every impulse.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris at once comprehended her intention, and
courteously advanced.</p>

<p>"Do you wish to return home?" he asked.</p>

<p>"If a carriage can be obtained."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span></p>

<p>"There can be no difficulty about that," he answered;
and he gave Hickory a look, and whispered a word
to Mr. Byrd, that sent them both speedily from the
room.</p>

<p>When he was left alone with her, he said:</p>

<p>"Before you leave my presence, Miss Dare, I wish to
urge upon you the necessity of patience. Any sudden
or violent act on your part now would result in no good,
and lead to much evil. Let me, then, pray you to
remain quiet in your home, confident that Mr. Orcutt
and myself will do all in our power to insure justice and
make the truth evident."</p>

<p>She bowed, but did not speak; while her impatient
eye, resting feverishly on the door, told of her anxiety
to depart.</p>

<p>"She will need watching," commented Mr. Ferris to
himself, and he, too, waited impatiently for the detectives'
return. When they came in he gave Imogene to
their charge, but the look he cast Byrd contained a
hint which led that gentleman to take his hat when
he went below to put Miss Dare into her carriage.</p>

<h2>XXXVII.</h2>

<h3>UNDER THE GREAT TREE.</h3>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">We but teach</span><br />
Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return<br />
To plague the inventor. This even-handed justice<br />
Commends the ingredients of our poisoned chalice<br />
To our own lips. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &mdash;<span class="smcap">Macbeth.</span><br />
<br /></div>


<div class='cap'>IMOGENE went to her home. Confused, disordered,
the prey of a thousand hopes and a thousand fears,
she sought for solitude and found it within the four walls
of the small room which was now her only refuge.</div>

<p>The two detectives who had followed her to the house&mdash;the
one in the carriage, the other on foot&mdash;met, as the
street-door closed upon her retreating form, and consulted
together as to their future course.</p>

<p>"Mr. Ferris thinks we ought to keep watch over the
house, to make sure she does not leave it again," announced
Mr. Byrd.</p>

<p>"Does he? Well, then, I am the man for that job,"
quoth Hickory. "I was on this very same beat last
night."</p>

<p>"Good reason why you should rest and give me a
turn at the business," declared the other.</p>

<p>"Do you want it?"</p>

<p>"I am willing to take it," said Byrd.</p>

<p>"Well, then, after nine o'clock you shall."</p>

<p>"Why after nine?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span></p>

<p>"Because if she's bent on skylarking, she'll leave the
house before then," laughed the other.</p>

<p>"And you want to be here if she goes out?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, <i>rather!</i>"</p>

<p>They compromised matters by both remaining, Byrd
within view of the house and Hickory on a corner within
hail. Neither expected much from this effort at surveillance,
there seeming to be no good reason why she
should venture forth into the streets again that night.
But the watchfulness of the true detective mind is unceasing.</p>

<p>Several hours passed. The peace of evening had come
at last to the troubled town. In the streets, especially,
its gentle influence was felt, and regions which had seethed
all day with a restless and impatient throng were fast settling
into their usual quiet and solitary condition. A new
moon hung in the west, and to Mr. Byrd, pacing the walk
in front of Imogene's door, it seemed as if he had never
seen the town look more lovely or less like the abode of
violence and crime. All was so quiet, especially in the
house opposite him, he was fast becoming convinced that
further precautions were needless, and that Imogene had
no intention of stirring abroad again, when the window
where her light burned suddenly became dark, and he
perceived the street door cautiously open, and her tall,
vailed figure emerge and pass rapidly up the street.
Merely stopping to give the signal to Hickory, he hastened
after her with rapid but cautious steps.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span></p>

<p>She went like one bound on no uncertain errand.
Though many of the walks were heavily shaded, and the
light of the lamps was not brilliant, she speeded on from
corner to corner, threading the business streets with
rapidity, and emerging upon the large and handsome
avenue that led up toward the eastern district of the town
before Hickory could overtake Byrd, and find sufficient
breath to ask:</p>

<p>"Where is she bound for? Who lives up this way?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Byrd, lowering his voice in
the fear of startling her into a knowledge of their presence.
"It may be she is going to Miss Tremaine's; the
High School is somewhere in this direction."</p>

<p>But even as they spoke, the gliding figure before them
turned into another street, and before they knew it, they
were on the car-track leading out to Somerset Park.</p>

<p>"Ha! I know now," whispered Hickory. "It is
Orcutt she is after." And pressing the arm of Byrd in
his enthusiasm, he speeded after her with renewed zeal.</p>

<p>Byrd, seeing no reason to dispute a fact that was every
moment becoming more evident, hurried forward also,
and after a long and breathless walk&mdash;for she seemed to
be urged onward by flying feet&mdash;they found themselves
within sight of the grand old trees that guarded the
entrance to the lawyer's somewhat spacious grounds.</p>

<p>"What are we going to do now?" asked Byrd, stopping,
as they heard the gate click behind her.</p>

<p>"Wait and watch," said Hickory. "She has not led<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
us this wild-goose chase for nothing." And leaping the
hedge, he began creeping up toward the house, leaving
his companion to follow or not, as he saw fit.</p>

<p>Meantime Imogene had passed up the walk and
paused before the front door. But a single look at it
seemed to satisfy her, for, moving hurriedly away, she
flitted around the corner of the house and stopped just
before the long windows whose brightly illumined sashes
proclaimed that the master of the house was still in his
library.</p>

<p>She seemed to feel relieved at this sight. Pausing, she
leaned against the frame of a trellis-work near by to
gather up her courage or regain her breath before proceeding
to make her presence known to the lawyer. As
she thus leaned, the peal of the church clock was heard,
striking the hour of nine. She started, possibly at finding
it so late, and bending forward, looked at the windows
before her with an anxious eye that soon caught sight of
a small opening left by the curtains having been drawn
together by a too hasty or a too careless hand, and
recognizing the opportunity it afforded for a glimpse into
the room before her, stepped with a light tread upon the
piazza and quietly peered within.</p>

<p>The sight she saw never left her memory.</p>

<p>Seated before a deadened fire, she beheld Mr. Orcutt.
He was neither writing nor reading, nor, in the true sense
of the word, thinking. The papers he had evidently
taken from his desk, lay at his side undisturbed, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
from one end of the room to the other, solitude, suffering,
and despair seemed to fill the atmosphere and weigh upon
its dreary occupant, till the single lamp which shone
beside him burned dimmer and dimmer, like a life going
out or a purpose vanishing in the gloom of a stealthily
approaching destiny.</p>

<p>Imogene, who had come to this place thus secretly and
at this late hour of the day with the sole intent of procuring
the advice of this man concerning the deception
which had been practised upon her before the trial, felt
her heart die within her as she surveyed this rigid figure
and realized all it implied. Though his position was
such she could not see his face, there was that in his
attitude which bespoke hopelessness and an utter weariness
of life, and as ash after ash fell from the grate, she
imagined how the gloom deepened on the brow which till
this hour had confronted the world with such undeviating
courage and confidence.</p>

<p>It was therefore a powerful shock to her when, in
another moment, he looked up, and, without moving his
body, turned his head slowly around in such a way as to
afford her a glimpse of his face. For, in all her memory
of it&mdash;and she had seen it distorted by many and various
emotions during the last few weeks&mdash;she had never beheld
it wear such a look as now. It gave her a new idea of
the man; it filled her with dismay, and sent the life-blood
from her cheeks. It fascinated her, as the glimpse of any
evil thing fascinates, and held her spell-bound long after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
he had turned back again to his silent contemplation of
the fire and its ever-drifting ashes. It was as if a vail
had been rent before her eyes, disclosing to her a living
soul writhing in secret struggle with its own worst passions;
and horrified at the revelation, more than horrified
at the remembrance that it was her own action of
the morning which had occasioned this change in one she
had long reverenced, if not loved, she sank helplessly
upon her knees and pressed her face to the window in a
prayer for courage to sustain this new woe and latest, if
not heaviest, disappointment.</p>

<p>It came while she was kneeling&mdash;came in the breath of
the cold night wind, perhaps; for, rising up, she turned
her forehead gratefully to the breeze, and drew in long
draughts of it before she lifted her hand and knocked
upon the window.</p>

<p>The sharp, shrill sound made by her fingers on the
pane reassured her as much as it startled him. Gathering
up her long cloak, which had fallen apart in her last
hurried movement, she waited with growing self-possession
for his appearance at the window.</p>

<p>He came almost immediately&mdash;came with his usual
hasty step and with much of his usual expression on his
well-disciplined features. Flinging aside the curtains, he
cried impatiently: "Who is there?" But at sight of the
tall figure of Imogene standing upright and firm on the
piazza without, he drew back with a gesture of dismay,
which was almost forbidding in its character.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span></p>

<p>She saw it, but did not pause. Pushing up the window,
she stepped into the room; then, as he did not offer to
help her, turned and shut the window behind her and
carefully arranged the curtains. He meantime stood
watching her with eyes in whose fierce light burned equal
love and equal anger.</p>

<p>When all was completed, she faced him. Instantly a
cry broke from his lips:</p>

<p>"You here!" he exclaimed, as if her presence were
more than he could meet or stand. But in another moment
the forlornness of her position seemed to strike him,
and he advanced toward her, saying in a voice husky
with passion: "Wretched woman, what have you done?
Was it not enough that for weeks, months now, you
have played with my love and misery as with toys, that
you should rise up at the last minute and crush me before
the whole world with a story, mad as it is false, of yourself
being a criminal and the destroyer of the woman for
whose death your miserable lover is being tried? Had
you no consideration, no pity, if not for yourself, ruined
by this day's work, for me, who have sacrificed every thing,
done every thing the most devoted man or lawyer could
do to save this fellow and win you for my wife?"</p>

<p>"Sir," said she, meeting the burning anger of his look
with the coldness of a set despair, as if in the doubt
awakened by his changed demeanor she sought to probe
his mind for its hidden secret, "I did what any other
woman would have done in my place. When we are
pushed to the wall we tell the truth."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span></p>

<p>"The truth!" Was that his laugh that rang startlingly
through the room? "The truth! You told the truth!
Imogene, Imogene, is any such farce necessary with
me?"</p>

<p>Her lips, which had opened, closed again, and she did
not answer for a moment; then she asked:</p>

<p>"How do you know that what I said was not the
truth?"</p>

<p>"How do I know?" He paused as if to get his
breath. "How do I know?" he repeated, calling up all
his self-control to sustain her gaze unmoved. "Do you
think I have lost my reason, Imogene, that you put
me such a question as that? How do I know you are
innocent? Recall your own words and acts since the
day we met at Mrs. Clemmens' house, and tell me how it
would be possible for me to think any thing else of
you?"</p>

<p>But her purpose did not relax, neither did she falter as
she returned:</p>

<p>"Mr. Orcutt, will you tell me what has ever been said
by me or what you have ever known me to do that would
make it certain I did not commit this crime myself?"</p>

<p>His indignation was too much for his courtesy.</p>

<p>"Imogene," he commanded, "be silent! I will not
listen to any further arguments of this sort. Isn't it
enough that you have destroyed my happiness, that you
should seek to sport with my good-sense? I say you are
innocent as a babe unborn, not only of the crime itself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
but of any complicity in it. Every word you have spoken,
every action you have taken, since the day of Mrs. Clemmens'
death, proves you to be the victim of a fixed
conviction totally at war with the statement you were
pleased to make to-day. Only your belief in the guilt of
another and your&mdash;your&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped, choked. The thought of his rival maddened
him.</p>

<p>She immediately seized the opportunity to say:</p>

<p>"Mr. Orcutt, I cannot argue about what I have done.
It is over and cannot be remedied. It is true I have
destroyed myself, but this is no time to think of that.
All I can think of or mourn over now is that, by
destroying myself, I have not succeeded in saving Craik
Mansell."</p>

<p>If her purpose was to probe the lawyer's soul for
the deadly wound that had turned all his sympathies
to gall, she was successful at last. Turning upon her
with a look in which despair and anger were strangely
mingled, he cried:</p>

<p>"And me, Imogene&mdash;have you no thought for me?"</p>

<p>"Sir," said she, "any thought from one disgraced as I
am now, would be an insult to one of your character and
position."</p>

<p>It was true. In the eyes of the world Tremont
Orcutt and Imogene Dare henceforth stood as far apart
as the poles. Realizing it only too well, he uttered a
half-inarticulate exclamation, and trod restlessly to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
other end of the room. When he came back, it was
with more of the lawyer's aspect and less of the baffled
lover's.</p>

<p>"Imogene," he said, "what could have induced you
to resort to an expedient so dreadful? Had you lost
confidence in me? Had I not told you I would save
this man from his threatened fate?"</p>

<p>"You cannot do every thing," she replied. "There
are limits even to a power like yours. I knew that
Craik was lost if I gave to the court the testimony which
Mr. Ferris expected from me."</p>

<p>"Ah, then," he cried, seizing with his usual quickness
at the admission which had thus unconsciously, perhaps,
slipped from her, "you acknowledge you uttered a perjury
to save yourself from making declarations you
believed to be hurtful to the prisoner?"</p>

<p>A faint smile crossed her lips, and her whole aspect
suddenly changed.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said; "I have no motive for hiding it
from you now. I perjured myself to escape destroying
Craik Mansell. I was scarcely the mistress of my own
actions. I had suffered so much I was ready to do any
thing to save the man I had so relentlessly pushed to his
doom. I forgot that God does not prosper a lie."</p>

<p>The jealous gleam which answered her from the lawyer's
eyes was a revelation.</p>

<p>"You regret, then," he said, "that you tossed my
happiness away with a breath of your perjured lips?"</p>

<p>"I regret I did not tell the truth and trust God."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span></p>

<p>At this answer, uttered with the simplicity of a penitent
spirit, Mr. Orcutt unconsciously drew back.</p>

<p>"And, may I ask, what has caused this sudden
regret?" he inquired, in a tone not far removed from
mockery; "the generous action of the prisoner in relieving
you from your self-imposed burden of guilt by an
acknowledgment that struck at the foundation of the
defence I had so carefully prepared?"</p>

<p>"No," was her short reply; "that could but afford me
joy. Of whatever sin he may be guilty, he is at least
free from the reproach of accepting deliverance at the
expense of a woman. I am sorry I said what I did
to-day, because a revelation has since been made to
me, which proves I could never have sustained myself
in the position I took, and that it was mere suicidal
folly in me to attempt to save Craik Mansell by such
means."</p>

<p>"A revelation?"</p>

<p>"Yes." And, forgetting all else in the purpose which
had actuated her in seeking this interview, Imogene drew
nearer to the lawyer and earnestly said: "There have
been some persons&mdash;I have perceived it&mdash;who have wondered
at my deep conviction of Craik Mansell's guilt.
But the reasons I had justified it. They were great,
greater than any one knew, greater even than <i>you</i> knew.
His mother&mdash;were she living&mdash;must have thought as I
did, had she been placed beside me and seen what I
have seen, and heard what I have heard from the time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
of Mrs. Clemmens' death. Not only were all the facts
brought against him in the trial known to me, but I saw
him&mdash;saw him with my own eyes, running from Mrs.
Clemmens' dining-room door at the very time we suppose
the murder to have been committed; that is, at five
minutes before noon on the fatal day."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" exclaimed Mr. Orcutt, in his astonishment.
"You are playing with my credulity, Imogene."</p>

<p>But she went on, letting her voice fall in awe of the
lawyer's startled look.</p>

<p>"No," she persisted; "I was in Professor Darling's
observatory. I was looking through a telescope, which
had been pointed toward the town. Mrs. Clemmens
was much in my mind at the time, and I took the notion
to glance at her house, when I saw what I have described
to you. I could not help remembering the time," she
added, "for I had looked at the clock but a moment
before."</p>

<p>"And it was five minutes before noon?" broke again
from the lawyer's lips, in what was almost an awe-struck
tone.</p>

<p>Troubled at an astonishment which seemed to partake
of the nature of alarm, she silently bowed her head.</p>

<p>"And you were looking at him&mdash;actually looking at
him&mdash;that very moment through a telescope perched a
mile or so away?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she bowed again.</p>

<p>Turning his face aside, Mr. Orcutt walked to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
hearth and began kicking the burnt-out logs with his
restless foot. As he did so, Imogene heard him mutter
between his set teeth:</p>

<p>"It is almost enough to make one believe in a God!"</p>

<p>Struck, horrified, she glided anxiously to his side.</p>

<p>"Do not you believe in a God?" she asked.</p>

<p>He was silent.</p>

<p>Amazed, almost frightened, for she had never heard
him breathe a word of scepticism before,&mdash;though, to be
sure, he had never mentioned the name of the Deity in
her presence,&mdash;she stood looking at him like one who had
received a blow; then she said:</p>

<p>"I believe in God. It is my punishment that I do. It
is He who wills blood for blood; who dooms the guilty
to a merited death. Oh, if He only would accept the
sacrifice I so willingly offer!&mdash;take the life I so little
value, and give me in return&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mansell's?" completed the lawyer, turning upon her
in a burst of fury he no longer had power to suppress.
"Is that your cry&mdash;always and forever your cry? You
drive me too far, Imogene. This mad and senseless
passion for a man who no longer loves you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Spare me!" rose from her trembling lips. "Let me
forget that."</p>

<p>But the great lawyer only laughed.</p>

<p>"You make it worth my while to save you the bitterness
of such a remembrance," he cried. Then, as she
remained silent, he changed his tone to one of careless
inquiry, and asked:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span></p>

<p>"Was it to tell this story of the prisoner having fled
from his aunt's house that you came here to-night?"</p>

<p>Recalled to the purpose of the hour, she answered,
hurriedly:</p>

<p>"Not entirely; that story was what Mr. Ferris expected
me to testify to in court this morning. You see
for yourself in what a position it would have put the
prisoner."</p>

<p>"And the revelation you have received?" the lawyer
coldly urged.</p>

<p>"Was of a deception that has been practised upon me&mdash;a
base deception by which I was led to think long ago
that Craik Mansell had admitted his guilt and only
trusted to the excellence of his defence to escape punishment."</p>

<p>"I do not understand," said Mr. Orcutt. "Who
could have practised such deception upon you?"</p>

<p>"The detectives," she murmured; "that rough, heartless
fellow they call Hickory." And, in a burst of indignation,
she told how she had been practised upon, and
what the results had been upon her belief, if not upon
the testimony which grew out of that belief.</p>

<p>The lawyer listened with a strange apathy. What
would once have aroused his fiercest indignation and
fired him to an exertion of his keenest powers, fell on
him now like the tedious repetition of an old and worn-out
tale. He scarcely looked up when she was done;
and despair&mdash;the first, perhaps, she had ever really felt&mdash;began<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
to close in around her as she saw how deep a gulf
she had dug between this man and herself by the inconsiderate
act which had robbed him of all hope of ever
making her his wife. Moved by this feeling, she suddenly
asked:</p>

<p>"Have you lost all interest in your client, Mr. Orcutt?
Have you no wish or hope remaining of seeing him
acquitted of this crime?"</p>

<p>"My client," responded the lawyer, with bitter emphasis,
"has taken his case into his own hands. It
would be presumptuous in me to attempt any thing further
in his favor."</p>

<p>"Mr. Orcutt!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" he scornfully laughed, with a quick yielding
to his passion as startling as it was unexpected, "you
thought you could play with me as you would; use my
skill and ignore the love that prompted it. You are a
clever woman, Imogene, but you went too far when you
considered my forbearance unlimited."</p>

<p>"And you forsake Craik Mansell, in the hour of his
extremity?"</p>

<p>"Craik Mansell has forsaken me."</p>

<p>This was true; for her sake her lover had thrown his
defence to the winds and rendered the assistance of his
counsel unavailable. Seeing her droop her head abashed,
Mr. Orcutt dryly proceeded.</p>

<p>"I do not know what may take place in court to-morrow,"
said he. "It is difficult to determine what will be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
the outcome of so complicated a case. The District
Attorney, in consideration of the deception which has
been practised upon you, may refuse to prosecute any
further; or, if the case goes on and the jury is called
upon for a verdict, they may or may not be moved by its
peculiar aspects to acquit a man of such generous dispositions.
If they are, I shall do nothing to hinder an
acquittal; but ask for no more active measures on my
part. I cannot plead for the lover of the woman who has
disgraced me."</p>

<p>This decision, from one she had trusted so implicitly,
seemed to crush her.</p>

<p>"Ah," she murmured, "if you did not believe him
guilty you would not leave him thus to his fate."</p>

<p>He gave her a short, side-long glance, half-mocking,
half-pitiful.</p>

<p>"If," she pursued, "you had felt even a passing gleam
of doubt, such as came to me when I discovered that he
had never really admitted his guilt, you would let no
mere mistake on the part of a woman turn you from your
duty as counsellor for a man on trial for his life."</p>

<p>His glance lost its pity and became wholly mocking.</p>

<p>"And do <i>you</i> cherish but passing gleams?" he sarcastically
asked.</p>

<p>She started back.</p>

<p>"I laugh at the inconsistency of women," he cried.
"You have sacrificed every thing, even risked your life
for a man you really believe guilty of crime; yet if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
another man similarly stained asked you for your compassion
only, you would fly from him as from a pestilence."</p>

<p>But no words he could utter of this sort were able to
raise any emotion in her now.</p>

<p>"Mr. Orcutt," she demanded, "do <i>you</i> believe Craik
Mansell innocent?"</p>

<p>His old mocking smile came back.</p>

<p>"Have I conducted his case as if I believed him
guilty?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, no; but you are his lawyer; you are bound not
to let your real thoughts appear. But in your secret
heart you did not, could not, believe he was free from a
crime to which he is linked by so many criminating circumstances?"</p>

<p>But his strange smile remaining unchanged, she seemed
to waken to a sudden doubt, and leaping impetuously to
his side, laid her hand on his arm and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, if you have ever cherished one hope of his
innocence, no matter how faint or small, tell me of it, even
if this last disclosure has convinced you of its folly!"</p>

<p>Giving her an icy look, he drew his arm slowly from
her grasp and replied:</p>

<p>"Mr. Mansell has never been considered guilty by
me."</p>

<p>"Never?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"Not even now?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not even now."</p>

<p>It seemed as if she could not believe his words.</p>

<p>"And yet you know all there is against him; all that I
do now!"</p>

<p>"I know he visited his aunt's house at or after the time
she was murdered, but that is no proof he killed her,
Miss Dare."</p>

<p>"No," she admitted with slow conviction, "no. But
why did he fly in that wild way when he left it? Why did
he go straight to Buffalo and not wait to give me the interview
he promised?"</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you?" Mr. Orcutt inquired, with a
dangerous sneer on his lips. "Do you wish to know why
this man&mdash;the man you have so loved&mdash;the man for
whom you would die this moment, has conducted himself
with such marked discretion?"</p>

<p>"Yes," came like a breath from between Imogene's
parted lips.</p>

<p>"Well," said the lawyer, dropping his words with cruel
clearness, "Mr. Mansell has a great faith in women. He
has such faith in you, Imogene Dare, he thinks you are
all you declare yourself to be; that in the hour you stood
up before the court and called yourself a murderer, you
spoke but the truth; that&mdash;&mdash;" He stopped; even his
scornful <i>aplomb</i> would not allow him to go on in the face
of the look she wore.</p>

<p>"Say&mdash;say those words again!" she gasped. "Let me
hear them once more. He thinks what?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span></p>

<p>"That you are what you proclaimed yourself to be this
day, the actual assailant and murderer of Mrs. Clemmens.
He has thought so all along, Miss Dare, why, I do not
know. Whether he saw any thing or heard any thing in
that house from which you saw him fly so abruptly, or
whether he relied solely upon the testimony of the ring,
which you must remember he never acknowledged having
received back from you, I only know that from the
minute he heard of his aunt's death, his suspicions flew
to you, and that, in despite of such suggestions as I felt
it judicious to make, they have never suffered shock or
been turned from their course from that day to this.
<i>Such</i> honor," concluded Mr. Orcutt, with dry sarcasm,
"does the man you love show to the woman who has
sacrificed for his sake all that the world holds dear."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I cannot believe it. You are mocking me," came
inarticulately from her lips, while she drew back, step by
step, till half the room lay between them.</p>

<p>"Mocking you? Miss Dare, he has shown his feelings
so palpably, I have often trembled lest the whole
court should see and understand them."</p>

<p>"You have trembled"&mdash;she could scarcely speak, the
rush of her emotion was so great&mdash;"<i>you</i> have trembled
lest the whole court should see he suspected me of this
crime?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then," she cried, "you must have been convinced,&mdash;Ah!"
she hurriedly interposed, with a sudden look of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
distrust, "you are not amusing yourself with me, are you,
Mr. Orcutt? So many traps have been laid for me from
time to time, I dare not trust the truth of my best friend.
Swear you believe Craik Mansell to have thought this of
me! Swear you have seen this dark thing lying in his
soul, or I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Will confront him myself with the question, if I have
to tear down the walls of the prison to reach him. His
mind I must and will know."</p>

<p>"Very well, then, you do. I have told you," declared
Mr. Orcutt. "Swearing would not make it any more
true."</p>

<p>Lifting her face to heaven, she suddenly fell on her
knees.</p>

<p>"O God!" she murmured, "help me to bear this
great joy!"</p>

<p>"<i>Joy!</i>"</p>

<p>The icy tone, the fierce surprise it expressed, started
her at once to her feet.</p>

<p>"Yes," she murmured, "joy! Don't you see that if he
thinks me guilty, he <i>must</i> be innocent? I am willing to
perish and fall from the ranks of good men and honorable
women to be sure of a fact like this!"</p>

<p>"Imogene, Imogene, would you drive me mad?"</p>

<p>She did not seem to hear.</p>

<p>"Craik, are you guiltless, then?" she was saying. "Is
the past all a dream! Are we two nothing but victims of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
dread and awful circumstances? Oh, we will see; life
is not ended yet!" And with a burst of hope that
seemed to transfigure her into another woman, she turned
toward the lawyer with the cry: "If he is innocent, he
can be saved. Nothing that has been done by him or
me can hurt him if this be so. God who watches over
this crime has His eye on the guilty one. Though his
sin be hidden under a mountain of deceit, it will yet
come forth. Guilt like his cannot remain hidden."</p>

<p>"You did not think this when you faced the court this
morning with perjury on your lips," came in slow, ironical
tones from her companion.</p>

<p>"Heaven sometimes accepts a sacrifice," she returned.
"But who will sacrifice himself for a man who could let
the trial of one he knew to be innocent go on unhindered?"</p>

<p>"Who, indeed!" came in almost stifled tones from the
lawyer's lips.</p>

<p>"If a stranger and not Craik Mansell slew Mrs. Clemmens,"
she went on, "and nothing but an incomprehensible
train of coincidences unites him and me to this act
of violence, then may God remember the words of the
widow, and in His almighty power call down such a
doom&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She ended with a gasp. Mr. Orcutt, with a sudden
movement, had laid his hand upon her lips.</p>

<p>"Hush!" he said, "let no curses issue from <i>your</i>
mouth. The guilty can perish without that."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span></p>

<p>Releasing herself from him in alarm, she drew back,
her eyes slowly dilating as she noted the dead whiteness
that had settled over his face, and taken even the hue of
life from his nervously trembling lip.</p>

<p>"Mr. Orcutt," she whispered, with a solemnity which
made them heedless that the lamp which had been burning
lower and lower in its socket was giving out its last
fitful rays, "if Craik Mansell did not kill the Widow
Clemmens who then did?"</p>

<p>Her question&mdash;or was it her look and tone?&mdash;seemed
to transfix Mr. Orcutt. But it was only for a moment.
Turning with a slight gesture to the table at his side, he
fumbled with his papers, still oblivious of the flaring
lamp, saying slowly:</p>

<p>"I have always supposed Gouverneur Hildreth to be
the true author of this crime."</p>

<p>"Gouverneur Hildreth?"</p>

<p>Mr. Orcutt bowed.</p>

<p>"I do not agree with you," she returned, moving
slowly toward the window. "I am no reader of human
hearts, as all my past history shows, but something&mdash;is it
the voice of God in my breast?&mdash;tells me that Gouverneur
Hildreth is as innocent as Craik Mansell, and that the
true murderer of Mrs. Clemmens&mdash;&mdash;" Her words
ended in a shriek. The light, which for so long a time
had been flickering to its end, had given one startling
flare in which the face of the man before her had flashed
on her view in a ghastly flame that seemed to separate it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
from all surrounding objects, then as suddenly gone out,
leaving the room in total darkness.</p>

<p>In the silence that followed, a quick sound as of rushing
feet was heard, then the window was pushed up
and the night air came moaning in. Imogene had fled.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Horace Byrd had not followed Hickory in his rush
toward the house. He had preferred to await results under
the great tree which, standing just inside the gate,
cast its mysterious and far-reaching shadow widely over
the wintry lawn. He was, therefore, alone during most
of the interview which Miss Dare held with Mr. Orcutt in
the library, and, being alone, felt himself a prey to his
sensations and the weirdness of the situation in which he
found himself.</p>

<p>Though no longer a victim to the passion with which
Miss Dare had at first inspired him, he was by no means
without feeling for this grand if somewhat misguided woman,
and his emotions, as he stood there awaiting the issue
of her last desperate attempt to aid the prisoner, were
strong enough to make any solitude welcome, though
this solitude for some reason held an influence which was
any thing but enlivening, if it was not actually depressing,
to one of his ready sensibilities.</p>

<p>The tree under which he had taken his stand was, as I
have intimated, an old one. It had stood there from
time immemorial, and was, as I have heard it since said,
at once the pride of Mr. Orcutt's heart and the chief ornament<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
of his grounds. Though devoid of foliage at the
time, its vast and symmetrical canopy of interlacing
branches had caught Mr. Byrd's attention from the first
moment of his entrance beneath it, and, preoccupied
as he was, he could not prevent his thoughts from reverting
now and then with a curious sensation of awe to
the immensity of those great limbs which branched above
him. His imagination was so powerfully affected at last,
he had a notion of leaving the spot and seeking a
nearer look-out in the belt of evergreens that hid the
crouching form of Hickory; but a spell seemed to
emanate from the huge trunk against which he leaned
that restrained him when he sought to go, and noticing
almost at the same moment that the path which Miss
Dare would have to take in her departure ran directly
under this tree, he yielded to the apathy of the moment
and remained where he was.</p>

<p>Soon after he was visited by Hickory.</p>

<p>"I can see nothing and hear nothing," was that individual's
hurried salutation. "She and Mr. Orcutt are
evidently still in the library, but I cannot get a clue
to what is going on. I shall keep up my watch, however,
for I want to catch a glimpse of her face as she
steps from the window." And he was off again before
Byrd could reply.</p>

<p>But the next instant he was back, panting and breathless.</p>

<p>"The light is out in the library," he cried; "we shall
see her no more to-night."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span></p>

<p>But scarcely had the words left his lips when a faint
sound was heard from the region of the piazza, and looking
eagerly up the path, they saw the form of Miss Dare
coming hurriedly toward them.</p>

<p>To slip around into the deepest shadow cast by the
tree was but the work of a moment. Meantime, the
moon shone brightly on the walk down which she was
speeding, and as, in the agitation of her departure, she
had forgotten to draw down her veil, they succeeded in
obtaining a view of her face. It was pale, and wore an
expression of fear, while her feet hasted as though she
were only filled with thoughts of escape.</p>

<p>Seeing this, the two detectives held their breaths, preparing
to follow her as soon as she had passed the tree.
But she did not pass the tree. Just as she got within
reach of its shadow, a commanding voice was heard calling
upon her to stop, and Mr. Orcutt came hurrying, in his
turn, down the path.</p>

<p>"I cannot let you go thus," he cried, pausing beside
her on the walk directly under the tree. "If you command
me to save Craik Mansell I must do it. What you
wish must be done, Imogene."</p>

<p>"My wishes should not be needed to lead you to do your
duty by the man you believe to be innocent of the charge
for which he is being tried," was her earnest and strangely
cold reply.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," he muttered, bitterly; "but&mdash;ah, Imogene,"
he suddenly broke forth, in a way to startle these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
two detectives, who, however suspicious they had been of
his passion, had never before had the opportunity of seeing
him under its control, "what have you made of me
with your bewildering graces and indomitable soul? Before
I knew you, life was a round of honorable duties and
serene pleasures. I lived in my profession, and found
my greatest delight in its exercise. But now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What now?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I seem"&mdash;he said, and the hard, cold selfishness that
underlay all his actions, however generous they may have
been in appearance, was apparent in his words and tones,&mdash;"I
seem to forget every thing, even my standing and
fame as a lawyer, in the one fear that, although lost to
me, you will yet live to give yourself to another."</p>

<p>"If you fear that I shall ever be so weak as to give myself
to Craik Mansell," was her steady reply, "you have
only to recall the promise I made you when you undertook
his case."</p>

<p>"Yes," said he, "but that was when you yourself believed
him guilty."</p>

<p>"I know," she returned; "but if he were not good
enough for me then, I am not good enough for him now.
Do you forget that I am blotted with a stain that can
never be effaced? When I stood up in court to-day and
denounced myself as guilty of crime, I signed away all my
chances of future happiness."</p>

<p>There was a pause; Mr. Orcutt seemed to be thinking.
From the position occupied by the two detectives his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
shadow could be seen oscillating to and fro on the lawn,
then, amid the hush of night&mdash;a deathly hush&mdash;undisturbed,
as Mr. Byrd afterward remarked, by so much as
the cracking of a twig, his voice rose quiet, yet vaguely
sinister, in the words:</p>

<p>"You have conquered. If any man suffers for this
crime it shall not be Craik Mansell, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sentence was never finished. Before the words
could leave his mouth a sudden strange and splitting
sound was heard above their heads, then a terrifying rush
took place, and a great limb lay upon the walk where but
a moment before the beautiful form of Imogene Dare
lifted itself by the side of the eminent lawyer.</p>

<p>When a full sense of the terrible nature of the calamity
which had just occurred swept across the minds of the
benumbed detectives, Mr. Byrd, recalling the words and
attitude of Imogene in face of a similar, if less fatal, catastrophe
at the hut, exclaimed under his breath:</p>

<p>"It is the vengeance of Heaven! Imogene Dare must
have been more guilty than we believed."</p>

<p>But when, after a superhuman exertion of strength,
and the assistance of many hands, the limb was at length
raised, it was found that, although both had been prostrated
by its weight, only one remained stretched and
senseless upon the ground, and that was not Imogene
Dare, but the great lawyer, Mr. Orcutt.</p>

<br /></div>


<div class='cap'>"MR. ORCUTT dead?"</div>

<p>"Dying, sir."</p>

<p>"How, when, where?"</p>

<p>"In his own house, sir. He has been struck down by
a falling limb."</p>

<p>The District Attorney, who had been roused from
his bed to hear these evil tidings, looked at the perturbed
face of the messenger before him&mdash;who was none
other than Mr. Byrd&mdash;and with difficulty restrained his
emotion.</p>

<p>"I sympathize with your horror and surprise," exclaimed
the detective, respectfully. Then, with a
strange mixture of embarrassment and agitation, added:
"It is considered absolutely necessary that you come
to the house. He may yet speak&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;you will
find Miss Dare there," he concluded, with a peculiarly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
hesitating glance and a rapid movement toward the
door.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris, who, as we know, cherished a strong
feeling of friendship for Mr. Orcutt, stared uneasily at
the departing form of the detective.</p>

<p>"What do you say?" he repeated. "Miss Dare
there, in Mr. Orcutt's house?"</p>

<p>The short "Yes," and the celerity with which Mr.
Byrd vanished, gave him the appearance of one anxious
to escape further inquiries.</p>

<p>Astonished, as well as greatly distressed, the District
Attorney made speedy preparations for following him,
and soon was in the street. He found it all alive
with eager citizens, who, notwithstanding the lateness
of the hour, were rushing hither and thither in search
of particulars concerning this sudden calamity; and upon
reaching the house itself, found it wellnigh surrounded
by an agitated throng of neighbors and friends.</p>

<p>Simply pausing at the gate to cast one glance at the
tree and its fallen limb, he made his way to the front
door. It was immediately opened. Dr. Tredwell, whose
face it was a shock to encounter in this place, stood
before him, and farther back a group of such favored
friends as had been allowed to enter the house. Something
in the look of the coroner, as he silently reached
forth his hand in salutation, added to the mysterious
impression which had been made upon Mr. Ferris by
the manner, if not words, of Mr. Byrd. Feeling that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
he was losing his self-command, the District Attorney
grasped the hand that was held out to him, and huskily
inquired if Mr. Orcutt was still alive.</p>

<p>The coroner, who had been standing before him with
a troubled brow and lowered eyes, gravely bowed, and
quietly leading the way, ushered him forward to Mr.
Orcutt's bedroom door. There he paused and looked as
if he would like to speak, but hastily changing his mind,
opened the door and motioned the District Attorney in.
As he did so, he cast a meaning and solemn look toward
the bed, then drew back, watching with evident anxiety
what the effect of the scene before him would have upon
this new witness.</p>

<p>A stupefying one it seemed, for Mr. Ferris, pausing in
his approach, looked at the cluster of persons about the
bed, and then drew his hand across his eyes like a man
in a maze. Suddenly he turned upon Dr. Tredwell with
the same strange look he had himself seen in the eyes of
Byrd, and said, almost as if the words were forced from
his lips:</p>

<p>"This is no new sight to us, doctor; we have been
spectators of a scene like this before."</p>

<p>That was it. As nearly as the alteration in circumstances
and surroundings would allow, the spectacle
before him was the same as that which he had encountered
months before in a small cottage at the other end of
the town. On the bed a pallid, senseless, but slowly
breathing form, whose features, stamped with the approach<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
of death, stared at them with marble-like rigidity from beneath
the heavy bandages which proclaimed the injury to
be one to the head. At his side the doctor&mdash;the same
one who had been called in to attend Mrs. Clemmens&mdash;wearing,
as he did then, a look of sombre anticipation
which Mr. Ferris expected every instant to see culminate
in the solemn gesture which he had used at the widow's
bedside before she spoke. Even the group of women
who clustered about the foot of the couch wore much the
same expression as those who waited for movement on
the part of Mrs. Clemmens; and had it not been for the
sight of Imogene Dare sitting immovable and watchful
on the farther side of the bed, he might almost have
imagined he was transported back to the old scene, and
that all this new horror under which he was laboring was
a dream from which he would speedily be awakened.</p>

<p>But Imogene's face, her look, her air of patient waiting,
were not to be mistaken. Attention once really attracted
to her, it was not possible for it to wander
elsewhere. Even the face of the dying man and the
countenance of the watchful physician paled in interest
before that fixed look which, never wavering,
never altering, studied the marble visage before her, for
the first faint signs of reawakening consciousness. Even
his sister, who, if weak of mind, was most certainly of a
loving disposition, seemed to feel the force of the tie that
bound Imogene to that pillow; and, though she hovered
nearer and nearer the beloved form as the weariful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
moments sped by, did not presume to interpose her grief
or her assistance between the burning eye of Imogene
and the immovable form of her stricken brother.</p>

<p>The hush that lay upon the room was unbroken save
by the agitated breaths of all present.</p>

<p>"Is there no hope?" whispered Mr. Ferris to Dr.
Tredwell, as, seeing no immediate prospect of change,
they sought for seats at the other side of the room.</p>

<p>"No; the wound is strangely like that which Mrs.
Clemmens received. He will rouse, probably, but he will
not live. Our only comfort is that in this case it is not a
murder."</p>

<p>The District Attorney made a gesture in the direction
of Imogene.</p>

<p>"How came she to be here?" he asked.</p>

<p>Dr. Tredwell rose and drew him from the room.</p>

<p>"It needs some explanation," he said; and began to
relate to him how Mr. Orcutt was escorting Miss Dare to
the gate when the bough fell which seemed likely to rob
him of his life.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris, through whose mind those old words of the
widow were running in a way that could only be accounted
for by the memories which the scene within had
awakened&mdash;"May the vengeance of Heaven light upon
the head of him who has brought me to this pass! May
the fate that has come upon me be visited upon him,
measure for measure, blow for blow, death for death!"&mdash;turned
with impressive gravity and asked if Miss Dare
had not been hurt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span></p>

<p>But Dr. Tredwell shook his head.</p>

<p>"She is not even bruised," said he.</p>

<p>"And yet was on his arm?"</p>

<p>"Possibly, though I very much doubt it."</p>

<p>"She was standing at his side," uttered the quiet voice
of Mr. Byrd in their ear; "and disappeared when he did,
under the falling branch. She must have been bruised,
though she says not. I do not think she is in a condition
to feel her injuries."</p>

<p>"You were present, then," observed Mr. Ferris, with a
meaning glance at the detective.</p>

<p>"I was present," he returned, with a look the District
Attorney did not find it difficult to understand.</p>

<p>"Is there any thing you ought to tell me?" Mr. Ferris
inquired, when a moment or so later the coroner had
been drawn away by a friend.</p>

<p>"I do not know," said Byrd. "Of the conversation
that passed between Miss Dare and Mr. Orcutt, but a
short portion came to our ears. It is her manner, her
actions, that have astonished us, and made us anxious to
have you upon the spot." And he told with what an expression
of fear she had fled from her interview with Mr.
Orcutt in the library, and then gave, as nearly as he
could, an account of what had passed between them before
the falling of the fatal limb. Finally he said:
"Hickory and I expected to find her lying crushed and
bleeding beneath, but instead of that, no sooner was the
bough lifted than she sprang to her knees, and seeing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
Mr. Orcutt lying before her insensible, bent over him
with that same expression of breathless awe and expectation
which you see in her now. It looks as if she were
waiting for him to rouse and finish the sentence that was
cut short by this catastrophe."</p>

<p>"And what was that sentence?"</p>

<p>"As near as I can recollect, it was this: 'If any man
suffers for this crime it shall not be Craik Mansell, but&mdash;&mdash;'
He did not have time to say whom."</p>

<p>"My poor friend!" ejaculated Mr. Ferris, "cut down
in the exercise of his duties! It is a mysterious providence&mdash;a
very mysterious providence!" And crossing
again to the sick-room, he went sadly in.</p>

<p>He found the aspect unchanged. On the pillow the
same white, immovable face; at the bedside the same
constant and expectant watchers. Imogene especially
seemed scarcely to have made a move in all the time of
his absence. Like a marble image watching over a form
of clay she sat silent, breathless, intent&mdash;a sight to draw
all eyes and satisfy none; for her look was not one of
grief, nor of awe, nor of hope, yet it had that within it
which made her presence there seem a matter of right
even to those who did not know the exact character of
the bond which united her to the unhappy sufferer.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris, who had been only too ready to accept Mr.
Byrd's explanation of her conduct, allowed himself to
gaze at her unhindered.</p>

<p>Overwhelmed, as he was, by the calamity which promised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
to rob the Bar of one of its most distinguished
advocates, and himself of a long-tried friend, he could
not but feel the throb of those deep interests which, in
the estimation of this woman at least, hung upon a word
which those dying lips might utter. And swayed by this
feeling, he unconsciously became a third watcher, though
for what, and in hope of what, he could scarcely have
told, so much was he benumbed by the suddenness of
this great catastrophe, and the extraordinary circumstances
by which it was surrounded.</p>

<p>And so one o'clock came and passed.</p>

<p>It was not the last time the clock struck before a
change came. The hour of two went by, then that of
three, and still, to the casual eye, all remained the same.
But ere the stroke of four was heard, Mr. Ferris, who
had relaxed his survey of Imogene to bestow a fuller attention
upon his friend, felt an indefinable sensation of
dismay assail him, and rising to his feet, drew a step or
so nearer the bed, and looked at its silent occupant with
the air of a man who would fain shut his eyes to the
meaning of what he sees before him. At the same
moment Mr. Byrd, who had just come in, found himself
attracted by the subtle difference he observed in the expression
of Miss Dare. The expectancy in her look was
gone, and its entire expression was that of awe. Advancing
to the side of Mr. Ferris, he glanced down at the
dying lawyer. He at once saw what it was that had so
attracted and moved the District Attorney. A change<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
had come over Mr. Orcutt's face. Though rigid still, and
unrelieved by any signs of returning consciousness, it was
no longer that of the man they knew, but a strange face,
owning the same features, but distinguished now by a
look sinister as it was unaccustomed, filling the breasts of
those who saw it with dismay, and making any contemplation
of his countenance more than painful to those
who loved him. Nor did it decrease as they watched
him. Like that charmed writing which appears on a
blank paper when it is subjected to the heat, the subtle,
unmistakable lines came out, moment by moment, on the
mask of his unconscious face, till even Imogene trembled,
and turned an appealing glance upon Mr. Ferris, as if to
bid him note this involuntary evidence of nature against
the purity and good intentions of the man who had
always stood so high in the world's regard. Then, satisfied,
perhaps, with the expression she encountered on the
face of the District Attorney, she looked back; and the
heavy minutes went on, only more drearily, and perhaps
more fearfully, than before.</p>

<p>Suddenly&mdash;was it at a gesture of the physician, or a
look from Imogene?&mdash;a thrill of expectation passed
through the room, and Dr. Tredwell, Mr. Ferris, and a
certain other gentleman who had but just entered at a
remote corner of the apartment, came hurriedly forward
and stood at the foot of the bed. At the same instant
Imogene rose, and motioning them a trifle aside, with an
air of mingled entreaty and command, bent slowly down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
toward the injured man. A look of recognition answered
her from the face upon the pillow, but she did not wait to
meet it, nor pause for the word that evidently trembled
on his momentarily conscious lip. Shutting out with her
form the group of anxious watchers behind her, she threw
all her soul into the regard with which she held him
enchained; then slowly, solemnly, but with unyielding
determination, uttered these words, which no one there
could know were but a repetition of a question made a
few eventful hours ago: "If Craik Mansell is not the man
who killed Mrs. Clemmens, do you, Mr. Orcutt, tell us
who is!" and, pausing, remained with her gaze fixed
demandingly on that of the lawyer, undeterred by the
smothered exclamations of those who witnessed this
scene and missed its clue or found it only in the supposition
that this last great shock had unsettled her mind.</p>

<p>The panting sufferer just trembling on the verge of life
thrilled all down his once alert and nervous frame, then
searching her face for one sign of relenting, unclosed his
rigid lips and said, with emphasis:</p>

<p>"Has not Fate spoken?"</p>

<p>Instantly Imogene sprang erect, and, amid the stifled
shrieks of the women and the muttered exclamations of
the men, pointed at the recumbent figure before them,
saying:</p>

<p>"You hear! Tremont Orcutt declares upon his death-bed
that it is the voice of Heaven which has spoken in
this dreadful calamity. You who were present when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
Mrs. Clemmens breathed her imprecations on the head of
her murderer, must know what that means."</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris, who of all present, perhaps, possessed the
greatest regard for the lawyer, gave an ejaculation of dismay
at this, and bounding forward, lifted her away from
the bedside he believed her to have basely desecrated.</p>

<p>"Madwoman," he cried, "where will your ravings end?
He will tell no such tale to me."</p>

<p>But when he bent above the lawyer with the question
forced from him by Miss Dare's words, he found him
already lapsed into that strange insensibility which was
every moment showing itself more and more to be the
precursor of death.</p>

<p>The sight seemed to rob Mr. Ferris of his last grain of
self-command. Rising, he confronted the dazed faces of
those about him with a severe look.</p>

<p>"This charge," said he, "is akin to that which Miss
Dare made against herself in the court yesterday morning.
When a woman has become crazed she no longer
knows what she says."</p>

<p>But Imogene, strong in the belief that the hand of
Heaven had pointed out the culprit for whom they had so
long been searching, shook her head in quiet denial, and
simply saying, "None of you know this man as I do,"
moved quietly aside to a dim corner, where she sat down
in calm expectation of another awakening on the part of
the dying lawyer.</p>

<p>It came soon&mdash;came before Mr. Ferris had recovered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
himself, or Dr. Tredwell had had a chance to give any
utterance to the emotions which this scene was calculated
to awaken.</p>

<p>Rousing as the widow had done, but seeming to see no
one, not even the physician who bent close at his side,
Mr. Orcutt lifted his voice again, this time in the old
stentorian tones which he used in court, and clearly,
firmly exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Blood will have blood!" Then in lower and more
familiar accents, cried: "Ah, Imogene, Imogene, it was
all for you!" And with her name on his lips, the great
lawyer closed his eyes again, and sank for the last time
into a state of insensibility.</p>

<p>Imogene at once rose.</p>

<p>"I must go," she murmured; "my duty in this place is
done." And she attempted to cross the floor.</p>

<p>But the purpose which had sustained her being at an
end, she felt the full weight of her misery, and looking in
the faces about her, and seeing nothing there but reprobation,
she tottered and would have fallen had not a
certain portly gentleman who stood near by put forth his
arm to sustain her. Accepting the support with gratitude,
but scarcely pausing to note from what source it came,
she turned for an instant to Mr. Ferris.</p>

<p>"I realize," said she, "with what surprise you must
have heard the revelation which has just come from Mr.
Orcutt's lips. So unexpected is it that you cannot yet
believe it, but the time will come when, of all the words<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
I have spoken, these alone will be found worthy your full
credit: that not Craik Mansell, not Gouverneur Hildreth,
not even unhappy Imogene Dare herself, could tell you
so much of the real cause and manner of Mrs. Clemmens'
death as this man who lies stricken here a victim of
Divine justice."</p>

<p>And merely stopping to cast one final look in the direction
of the bed, she stumbled from the room. A few
minutes later and she reached the front door; but only
to fall against the lintel with the moan:</p>

<p>"My words are true, but who will ever believe them?"</p>

<p>"Pardon me," exclaimed a bland and fatherly voice
over her shoulder, "I am a man who can believe in any
thing. Put your confidence in me, Miss Dare, and we
will see&mdash;we will see."</p>

<p>Startled by her surprise into new life, she gave one
glance at the gentleman who had followed her to the
door. It was the same who had offered her his arm, and
whom she supposed to have remained behind her in Mr.
Orcutt's room. She saw before her a large comfortable-looking
personage of middle age, of no great pretensions
to elegance or culture, but bearing that within his face
which oddly enough baffled her understanding while it
encouraged her trust. This was the more peculiar in
that he was not looking at her, but stood with his eyes
fixed on the fading light of the hall-lamp, which he surveyed
with an expression of concern that almost amounted
to pity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sir, who are you?" she tremblingly asked.</p>

<p>Dropping his eyes from the lamp, he riveted them upon
the veil she held tightly clasped in her right hand.</p>

<p>"If you will allow me the liberty of whispering in your
ear, I will soon tell you," said he.</p>

<p>She bent her weary head downward; he at once leaned
toward her and murmured a half-dozen words that made
her instantly start erect with new light in her eyes.</p>

<p>"And you will help me?" she cried.</p>

<p>"What else am I here for?" he answered.</p>

<p>And turning toward a quiet figure which she now saw
for the first time standing on the threshold of a small
room near by, he said with the calmness of a master:</p>

<p>"Hickory, see that no one enters or leaves the sick-room
till I return." And offering Imogene his arm, he
conducted her into the library, the door of which he
shut to behind them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>

<div class='poem'>

Was once thought honest.   &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &mdash;<span class="smcap">Macbeth.</span><br />
<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>AN hour later, as Mr. Ferris was leaving the house in
company with Dr. Tredwell, he felt himself
stopped by a slight touch on his arm. Turning about he
saw Hickory.</div>

<p>"Beg pardon, sirs," said the detective, with a short
bow, "but there's a gentleman, in the library who would
like to see you before you go."</p>

<p>They at once turned to the room indicated. But at
sight of its well-known features&mdash;its huge cases of books,
its large centre-table profusely littered with papers, the
burnt-out grate, the empty arm-chair&mdash;they paused, and
it was with difficulty they could recover themselves sufficiently
to enter. When they did, their first glance was
toward the gentleman they saw standing in a distant
window, apparently perusing a book.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" inquired Mr. Ferris of his companion.</p>

<p>"I cannot imagine," returned the other.</p>

<p>Hearing voices, the gentleman advanced.</p>

<p>"Ah," said he, "allow me to introduce myself. I am
Mr. Gryce, of the New York Detective Service."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Gryce!" repeated the District Attorney, in astonishment.</p>

<p>The famous detective bowed. "I have come," said
he, "upon a summons received by me in Utica not six
hours ago. It was sent by a subordinate of mine interested
in the trial now going on before the court. Horace
Byrd is his name. I hope he is well liked here and has
your confidence."</p>

<p>"Mr. Byrd is well enough liked," rejoined Mr. Ferris,
"but I gave him no orders to send for you. At what
hour was the telegram dated?"</p>

<p>"At half-past eleven; immediately after the accident
to Mr. Orcutt."</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>"He probably felt himself inadequate to meet this new
emergency. He is a young man, and the affair is certainly
a complicated one."</p>

<p>The District Attorney, who had been studying the
countenance of the able detective before him, bowed
courteously.</p>

<p>"I am not displeased to see you," said he. "If you
have been in the room above&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The other gravely bowed.</p>

<p>"You know probably of the outrageous accusation
which has just been made against our best lawyer and
most-esteemed citizen. It is but one of many which this
same woman has made; and while it is to be regarded as
the ravings of lunacy, still your character and ability may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
weigh much in lifting the opprobrium which any such
accusation, however unfounded, is calculated to throw
around the memory of my dying friend."</p>

<p>"Sir," returned Mr. Gryce, shifting his gaze uneasily
from one small object to another in that dismal room, till
all and every article it contained seemed to partake of his
mysterious confidence, "this is a world of disappointment
and deceit. Intellects we admired, hearts in which
we trusted, turn out frequently to be the abodes of falsehood
and violence. It is dreadful, but it is true."</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris, struck aghast, looked at the detective with
severe disapprobation.</p>

<p>"Is it possible," he asked, "that you have allowed
yourself to give any credence to the delirious utterances
of a man suffering from a wound on the head, or to the
frantic words of a woman who has already abused the
ears of the court by a deliberate perjury?" While Dr.
Tredwell, equally indignant and even more impatient,
rapped with his knuckles on the table by which he stood,
and cried:</p>

<p>"Pooh, pooh, the man cannot be such a fool!"</p>

<p>A solemn smile crossed the features of the detective.</p>

<p>"Many persons have listened to the aspersion you denounce.
Active measures will be needed to prevent its
going farther."</p>

<p>"I have commanded silence," said Dr. Tredwell. "Respect
for Mr. Orcutt will cause my wishes to be obeyed."</p>

<p>"Does Mr. Orcutt enjoy the universal respect of the
town?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span></p>

<p>"He does," was the stern reply.</p>

<p>"It behooves us, then," said Mr. Gryce, "to clear his
memory from every doubt by a strict inquiry into his relations
with the murdered woman."</p>

<p>"They are known," returned Mr. Ferris, with grim reserve.
"They were such as any man might hold with
the woman at whose house he finds it convenient to take
his daily dinner. She was to him the provider of a good
meal."</p>

<p>Mr. Gryce's eye travelled slowly toward Mr. Ferris'
shirt stud.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said he, "do you forget that Mr. Orcutt
was on the scene of murder some minutes before the rest
of you arrived? Let the attention of people once be directed
toward him as a suspicious party, and they will be
likely to remember this fact."</p>

<p>Astounded, both men drew back.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that remark?" they asked.</p>

<p>"I mean," said Mr. Gryce, "that Mr. Orcutt's visit to
Mrs. Clemmens' house on the morning of the murder will
be apt to be recalled by persons of a suspicious tendency
as having given him an opportunity to commit the crime."</p>

<p>"People are not such fools," cried Dr. Tredwell; while
Mr. Ferris, in a tone of mingled incredulity and anger,
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"And do you, a reputable detective, and, as I have
been told, a man of excellent judgment, presume to say
that there could be found any one in this town, or even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
in this country, who could let his suspicions carry him
so far as to hint that Mr. Orcutt struck this woman
with his own hand in the minute or two that elapsed
between his going into her house and his coming out
again with tidings of her death?"</p>

<p>"Those who remember that he had been a participator
in the lengthy discussion which had just taken
place on the court-house steps as to how a man might
commit a crime without laying himself open to the risk
of detection, might&mdash;yes, sir."</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris and the coroner, who, whatever their doubts
or fears, had never for an instant seriously believed the
dying words of Mr. Orcutt to be those of confession,
gazed in consternation at the detective, and finally inquired:</p>

<p>"Do you realize what you are saying?"</p>

<p>Mr. Gryce drew a deep breath, and shifted his gaze to
the next stud in Mr. Ferris' shirt-front.</p>

<p>"I have never been accused of speaking lightly," he
remarked. Then, with quiet insistence, asked: "Where
was Mrs. Clemmens believed to get the money she lived
on?"</p>

<p>"It is not known," rejoined the District Attorney.</p>

<p>"Yet she left a nice little sum behind her?"</p>

<p>"Five thousand dollars," declared the coroner.</p>

<p>"Strange that, in a town like this, no one should know
where it came from?" suggested the detective.</p>

<p>The two gentlemen were silent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was a good deal to come from Mr. Orcutt in payment
of a single meal a day!" continued Mr. Gryce.</p>

<p>"No one has ever supposed it did come from Mr.
Orcutt," remarked Mr. Ferris, with some severity.</p>

<p>"But does any one know it did not?" ventured the
detective.</p>

<p>Dr. Tredwell and the District Attorney looked at each
other, but did not reply.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," pursued Mr. Gryce, after a moment of
quiet waiting, "this is without exception the most
serious moment of my life. Never in the course of my
experience&mdash;and that includes much&mdash;have I been
placed in a more trying position than now. To allow
one's self to doubt, much less to question, the integrity
of so eminent a man, seems to me only less dreadful
than it does to you; yet, for all that, were I his friend,
as I certainly am his admirer, I would say: 'Sift this
matter to the bottom; let us know if this great lawyer
has any more in favor of his innocence than the
other gentlemen who have been publicly accused of this
crime.'"</p>

<p>"But," protested Dr. Tredwell, seeing that the District
Attorney was too much moved to speak, "you
forget the evidences which underlay the accusation of
these <i>other</i> gentlemen; also that of all the persons who,
from the day the widow was struck till now, have been
in any way associated with suspicion, Mr. Orcutt
is the only one who could have had no earthly motive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
for injuring this humble woman, even if he were all he
would have to be to first perform such a brutal deed
and then carry out his hypocrisy to the point of using
his skill as a criminal lawyer to defend another man
falsely accused of the crime."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir," said the detective, "but I
forget nothing. I only bring to the consideration of this
subject a totally unprejudiced mind and an experience
which has taught me never to omit testing the truth of
a charge because it seems at first blush false, preposterous,
and without visible foundation. If you will recall
the conversation to which I have just alluded as
having been held on the court-house steps on the morning
Mrs. Clemmens was murdered, you will remember
that it was the intellectual crime that was discussed&mdash;the
crime of an intelligent man, safe in the knowledge
that his motive for doing such a deed was a secret to
the world."</p>

<p>"My God!" exclaimed Mr. Ferris, under his breath,
"the man seems to be in earnest!"</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," pursued Mr. Gryce, with more dignity
than he had hitherto seen fit to assume, "it is not my
usual practice to express myself as openly as I have done
here to-day. In all ordinary cases I consider it expedient
to reserve intact my suspicions and my doubts till I
have completed my discoveries and arranged my arguments
so as to bear out with some show of reason whatever
statement I may feel obliged to make. But the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
extraordinary features of this affair, and the fact that
so many were present at the scene we have just left, have
caused me to change my usual tactics. Though far from
ready to say that Mr. Orcutt's words were those of confession,
I still see much reason to doubt his innocence,
and, feeling thus, am quite willing you should know it in
time to prepare for the worst."</p>

<p>"Then you propose making what has occurred here
public?" asked Mr. Ferris, with emotion.</p>

<p>"Not so," was the detective's ready reply. "On the
contrary, I was about to suggest that you did something
more than lay a command of silence upon those who
were present."</p>

<p>The District Attorney, who, as he afterward said, felt
as if he were laboring under some oppressive nightmare,
turned to the coroner and said:</p>

<p>"Dr. Tredwell, what do you advise me to do? Terrible
as this shock has been, and serious as is the duty it
possibly involves, I have never allowed myself to shrink
from doing what was right simply because it afforded
suffering to myself or indignity to my friends. Do you
think I am called upon to pursue this matter?"</p>

<p>The coroner, troubled, anxious, and nearly as much
overwhelmed as the District Attorney, did not immediately
reply. Indeed, the situation was one to upset any
man of whatever calibre. Finally he turned to Mr.
Gryce.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gryce," said he, "we are, as you have observed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
friends of the dying man, and, being so, may miss our
duty in our sympathy. What do you think ought to be
done, in justice to him, the prisoner, and the positions
which we both occupy?"</p>

<p>"Well, sirs," rejoined Mr. Gryce, "it is not usual,
perhaps, for a man in my position to offer actual advice
to gentlemen in yours; but if you wish to know what
course I should pursue if I were in your places, I should
say: First, require the witnesses still lingering around
the dying man to promise that they will not divulge what
was there said till a week has fully elapsed; next, adjourn
the case now before the court for the same decent length
of time; and, lastly, trust me and the two men you
have hitherto employed, to find out if there is any thing
in Mr. Orcutt's past history of a nature to make you
tremble if the world hears of the words which escaped
him on his death-bed. We shall probably need but a
week."</p>

<p>"And Miss Dare?"</p>

<p>"Has already promised secrecy."</p>

<p>There was nothing in all this to alarm their fears;
every thing, on the contrary, to allay them.</p>

<p>The coroner gave a nod of approval to Mr. Ferris, and
both signified their acquiescence in the measures proposed.</p>

<p>Mr. Gryce at once assumed his usual genial air.</p>

<p>"You may trust me," said he, "to exercise all the
discretion you would yourselves show under the circumstances.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
I have no wish to see the name of such a man
blasted by an ineffaceable stain." And he bowed as if
about to leave the room.</p>

<p>But Mr. Ferris, who had observed this movement with
an air of some uneasiness, suddenly stepped forward and
stopped him.</p>

<p>"I wish to ask," said he, "whether superstition has
had any thing to do with this readiness on your part to
impute the worst meaning to the chance phrases which
have fallen from the lips of our severely injured friend.
Because his end seems in some regards to mirror that of
the widow, have you allowed a remembrance of the
words she made use of in the face of death to influence
your good judgment as to the identity of Mr. Orcutt with
her assassin?"</p>

<p>The face of Mr. Gryce assumed its grimmest aspect.</p>

<p>"Do you think this catastrophe was necessary to draw
my attention to Mr. Orcutt? To a man acquainted with
the extraordinary coincidence that marked the discovery
of Mrs. Clemmens' murder, the mystery must be that Mr.
Orcutt has gone unsuspected for so long." And assuming
an argumentative air, he asked:</p>

<p>"Were either of you two gentlemen present at the conversation
I have mentioned as taking place on the court-house
steps the morning Mrs. Clemmens was murdered?"</p>

<p>"I was," said the District Attorney.</p>

<p>"You remember, then, the hunchback who was so free
with his views?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span></p>

<p>"Most certainly."</p>

<p>"And know, perhaps, who that hunchback was?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You will not be surprised, then, if I recall to you the
special incidents of that hour. A group of lawyers,
among them Mr. Orcutt, are amusing <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'thumselves'">themselves</ins> with an
off-hand chat concerning criminals and the clumsy way
in which, as a rule, they plan and execute their crimes. All
seem to agree that a murder is usually followed by detection,
when suddenly a stranger speaks and tells them that
the true way to make a success of the crime is to choose a
thoroughfare for the scene of tragedy, and employ a
weapon that has been picked up on the spot. What happens?
Within five minutes after this piece of gratuitous
information, or as soon as Mr. Orcutt can cross the
street, Mrs. Clemmens is found lying in her blood, struck
down by a stick of wood picked up from her own hearth-stone.
Is this chance? If so, 'tis a very curious one."</p>

<p>"I don't deny it," said Doctor Tredwell.</p>

<p>"I believe you never did deny it," quickly retorted the
detective. "Am I not right in saying that it struck you
so forcibly at the time as to lead you into supposing some
collusion between the hunchback and the murderer?"</p>

<p>"It certainly did," admitted the coroner.</p>

<p>"Very well," proceeded Mr. Gryce. "Now as there
could have been no collusion between these parties, the
hunchback being no other person than myself, what are
we to think of this murder? That it was a coincidence,
or an actual result of the hunchback's words?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Tredwell and Mr. Ferris were both silent.</p>

<p>"Sirs," continued Mr. Gryce, feeling, perhaps, that
perfect openness was necessary in order to win entire confidence,
"I am not given to boasting or to a too-free expression
of my opinion, but if I had been ignorant of this
affair, and one of my men had come to me and said: 'A
mysterious murder has just taken place, marked by this
extraordinary feature, that it is a precise reproduction of
a supposable case of crime which has just been discussed
by a group of indifferent persons in the public street,' and
then had asked me where to look for the assassin, I
should have said: 'Search for that man who heard the
discussion through, was among the first to leave the
group, and was the first to show himself upon the scene
of murder.' To be sure, when Byrd did come to me
with this story, I was silent, for the man who fulfilled
these conditions was Mr. Orcutt."</p>

<p>"Then," said Mr. Ferris, "you mean to say that you
would have suspected Mr. Orcutt of this crime long ago
if he had not been a man of such position and eminence?"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," was Mr. Gryce's reply.</p>

<p>If the expression was unequivocal, his air was still more
so. Shocked and disturbed, both gentlemen fell back.
The detective at once advanced and opened the door.</p>

<p>It was time. Mr. Byrd had been tapping upon it for
some minutes, and now hastily came in. His face told
the nature of his errand before he spoke.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am sorry to be obliged to inform you&mdash;&mdash;" he
began.</p>

<p>"Mr. Orcutt is dead?" quickly interposed Mr. Ferris.</p>

<p>The young detective solemnly bowed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XL.</h2>

<h3>IN THE PRISON.</h3>

<div class='poem'>
The jury passing on the prisoner's life,<br />
May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two<br />
Guiltier than him they try.<br />
<div class='sig'>
&mdash;<span class="smcap">Measure for Measure.</span><br /></div>
<br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
Such welcome and unwelcome things at once<br />
'Tis hard to reconcile. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &mdash;<span class="smcap">Macbeth.</span><br />
<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>MR. MANSELL sat in his cell, the prey of gloomy
and perturbed thought. He knew Mr. Orcutt
was dead; he had been told of it early in the morning by
his jailer, but of the circumstances which attended that
death he knew nothing, save that the lawyer had been
struck by a limb falling from a tree in his own garden.</div>

<p>The few moments during which the court had met for
the purpose of re-adjournment had added but little to his
enlightenment. A marked reserve had characterized the
whole proceedings; and though an indefinable instinct had
told him that in some mysterious way his cause had been
helped rather than injured by this calamity to his counsel,
he found no one ready to volunteer those explanations
which his great interest in the matter certainly demanded.
The hour, therefore, which he spent in solitude upon his
return to prison was one of great anxiety, and it was quite a
welcome relief when the cell door opened and the keeper
ushered in a strange gentleman. Supposing it to be the new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
counsel he had chosen at haphazard from a list of names that
had been offered him, Mr. Mansell rose. But a second
glance assured him he had made a mistake in supposing
this person to be a lawyer, and stepping back he awaited
his approach with mingled curiosity and reserve.</p>

<p>The stranger, who seemed to be perfectly at home in
the narrow quarters in which he found himself, advanced
with a frank air.</p>

<p>"My name is Gryce," said he, "and I am a detective.
The District Attorney, who, as you know, has been placed
in a very embarrassing situation by the events of the last
two days, has accepted my services in connection with
those of the two men already employed by him, in the
hope that my greater experience may assist him in determining
which, of all the persons who have been accused,
or who have accused themselves, of murdering Mrs. Clemmens,
is the actual perpetrator of that deed. Do you require
any further assurance of my being in the confidence of Mr.
Ferris than the fact that I am here, and in full liberty to
talk with you?"</p>

<p>"No," returned the other, after a short but close study
of his visitor.</p>

<p>"Very well, then," continued the detective, with a comfortable
air of ease, "I will speak to the point; and the
first thing I will say is, that upon looking at the evidence
against you, and hearing what I have heard from various
sources since I came to town, I know you are not the man
who killed Mrs. Clemmens. To be sure, you have declined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
to explain certain points, but I think you can explain
them, and if you will only inform me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pardon me," interrupted Mr. Mansell, gravely; "but
you say you are a detective. Now, I have no information
to give a detective."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" was the imperturbable query.</p>

<p>"Quite," was the quick reply.</p>

<p>"You are then determined upon going to the scaffold,
whether or no?" remarked Mr. Gryce, somewhat grimly.</p>

<p>"Yes, if to escape it I must confide in a detective."</p>

<p>"Then you do wrong," declared the other; "as I will
immediately proceed to show you. Mr. Mansell, you
are, of course, aware of the manner of Mr. Orcutt's
death?"</p>

<p>"I know he was struck by a falling limb."</p>

<p>"Do you know what he was doing when this occurred?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"He was escorting Miss Dare down to the gate."</p>

<p>The prisoner, whose countenance had brightened at the
mention of his lawyer, turned a deadly white at this.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;and was Miss Dare hurt?" he asked.</p>

<p>The detective shook his head.</p>

<p>"Then why do you tell me this?"</p>

<p>"Because it has much to do with the occasion of my
coming here, Mr. Mansell," proceeded Mr. Gryce, in
that tone of completely understanding himself which he
knew so well how to assume with men of the prisoner's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
stamp. "I am going to speak to you without circumlocution
or disguise. I am going to put your position before
you just as it is. You are on trial for a murder of
which not only yourself, but another man, was suspected.
Why are you on trial instead of him? Because you were
reticent in regard to certain matters which common-sense
would say you ought to be able to explain. Why were
you reticent? There can be but one answer. Because
you feared to implicate another person, for whose happiness
and honor you had more regard than for your own.
Who was that other person? The woman who stood up
in court yesterday and declared she had herself committed
this crime. What is the conclusion? You believe,
and have always believed, Miss Dare to be the
assassin of Mrs. Clemmens."</p>

<p>The prisoner, whose pallor had increased with every
word the detective uttered, leaped to his feet at this last
sentence.</p>

<p>"You have no right to say that!" he vehemently
asseverated. "What do you know of my thoughts or my
beliefs? Do I carry my convictions on my sleeve? I
am not the man to betray my ideas or feelings to the
world."</p>

<p>Mr. Gryce smiled. To be sure, this expression of silent
complacency was directed to the grating of the
window overhead, but it was none the less effectual on
that account. Mr. Mansell, despite his self-command,
began to look uneasy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span></p>

<p>"Prove your words!" he cried. "Show that these
have been my convictions!"</p>

<p>"Very well," returned Mr. Gryce. "Why were you
so long silent about the ring? Because you did not wish
to compromise Miss Dare by declaring she did not return
it to you, as she had said. Why did you try to stop
her in the midst of her testimony yesterday? Because
you saw it was going to end in confession. Finally, why
did you throw aside your defence, and instead of proclaiming
yourself guilty, simply tell how you were able to
reach Monteith Quarry Station in ninety minutes? Because
you feared her guilt would be confirmed if her
statements were investigated, and were willing to sacrifice
every thing but the truth in order to save her."</p>

<p>"You give me credit for a great deal of generosity,"
coldly replied the prisoner. "After the evidence brought
against me by the prosecution, I should think my guilt
would be accepted as proved the moment I showed that
I had not left Mrs. Clemmens' house at the time she was
believed to be murdered."</p>

<p>"And so it would," responded Mr. Gryce, "if the
prosecution had not seen reason to believe that the moment
of Mrs. Clemmens' death has been put too early.
We now think she was not struck till some time after
twelve, instead of five minutes before."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" said Mr. Mansell, with stern self-control.</p>

<p>Mr. Gryce, whose carelessly roving eye told little of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
the close study with which he was honoring the man
before him, nodded with grave decision.</p>

<p>"You could add very much to our convictions on this
point," he observed, "by telling what it was you saw or
heard in Mrs. Clemmens' house at the moment you fled
from it so abruptly."</p>

<p>"How do you know I fled from it abruptly?"</p>

<p>"You were seen. The fact has not appeared in court,
but a witness we might name perceived you flying from
your aunt's door to the swamp as if your life depended
upon the speed you made."</p>

<p>"And with that fact added to all the rest you have
against me, you say you believe me innocent?" exclaimed
Mr. Mansell.</p>

<p>"Yes; for I have also said I believe Mrs. Clemmens
not to have been assaulted till after the hour of noon.
You fled from the door at precisely five minutes before
it."</p>

<p>The uneasiness of Mr. Mansell's face increased, till it
amounted to agitation.</p>

<p>"And may I ask," said he, "what has happened to
make you believe she was not struck at the moment
hitherto supposed?"</p>

<p>"Ah, now," replied the detective, "we come down to
facts." And leaning with a confidential air toward the
prisoner, he quietly said: "Your counsel has died, for
one thing."</p>

<p>Astonished as much by the tone as the tenor of these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
words, Mr. Mansell drew back from his visitor in some
distrust. Seeing it, Mr. Gryce edged still farther forward,
and calmly continued:</p>

<p>"If no one has told you the particulars of Mr. Orcutt's
death, you probably do not know why Miss Dare was at
his house last evening?"</p>

<p>The look of the prisoner was sufficient reply.</p>

<p>"She went there," resumed Mr. Gryce, with composure,
"to tell him that her whole evidence against you
had been given under the belief that you were guilty of
the crime with which you had been charged; that by a
trick of my fellow-detectives, Hickory and Byrd, she had
been deceived into thinking you had actually admitted
your guilt to her; and that she had only been undeceived
after she had uttered the perjury with which she sought
to save you yesterday morning."</p>

<p>"Perjury?" escaped involuntarily from Craik Mansell's
lips.</p>

<p>"Yes," repeated the detective, "perjury. Miss Dare
lied when she said she had been to Mrs. Clemmens' cottage
on the morning of the murder. She was not there,
nor did she lift her hand against the widow's life. That
tale she told to escape telling another which she thought
would insure your doom."</p>

<p>"You have been talking to Miss Dare?" suggested
the prisoner, with subdued sarcasm.</p>

<p>"I have been talking to my two men," was the unmoved
retort, "to Hickory and to Byrd, and they not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
only confirm this statement of hers in regard to the
deception they played upon her, but say enough to show
she could not have been guilty of the crime, because at
that time she honestly believed you to be so."</p>

<p>"I do not understand you," cried the prisoner, in a
voice that, despite his marked self-control, showed the
presence of genuine emotion.</p>

<p>Mr. Gryce at once went into particulars. He was anxious
to have Craik Mansell's mind disabused of the notion
that Imogene had committed this crime, since upon
that notion he believed his unfortunate reticence to rest.
He therefore gave him a full relation of the scene in the
hut, together with all its consequences.</p>

<p>Mr. Mansell listened like a man in a dream. Some
fact in the past evidently made this story incredible to
him.</p>

<p>Seeing it, Mr. Gryce did not wait to hear his comments,
but upon finishing his account, exclaimed, with a confident
air:</p>

<p>"Such testimony is conclusive. It is impossible to
consider Miss Dare guilty, after an insight of this kind
into the real state of her mind. Even she has seen the
uselessness of persisting in her self-accusation, and, as I
have already told you, went to Mr. Orcutt's house in
order to explain to him her past conduct, and ask his
advice for the future. She learned something else before
her interview with Mr. Orcutt ended," continued the detective,
impressively. "She learned that she had not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
only been mistaken in supposing you had admitted your
guilt, but that you could not have been guilty, because
you had always believed her to be so. It has been a
mutual case of suspicion, you see, and argues innocence
on the part of you both. Or so it seems to the prosecution.
How does it seem to you?"</p>

<p>"Would it help my cause to say?"</p>

<p>"It would help your cause to tell what sent you so
abruptly from Mrs. Clemmens' house the morning she
was murdered."</p>

<p>"I do not see how," returned the prisoner.</p>

<p>The glance of Mr. Gryce settled confidentially on his
right hand where it lay outspread upon his ample knee.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mansell," he inquired, "have you no curiosity to
know any details of the accident by which you have unexpectedly
been deprived of a counsel?"</p>

<p>Evidently surprised at this sudden change of subject,
Craik replied:</p>

<p>"If I had not hoped you would understand my anxiety
and presently relieve it, I could not have shown you as
much patience as I have."</p>

<p>"Very well," rejoined Mr. Gryce, altering his manner
with a suddenness that evidently alarmed his listener.
"Mr. Orcutt did not die immediately after he was struck
down. He lived some hours; lived to say some words
that have materially changed the suspicions of persons
interested in the case he was defending."</p>

<p>"Mr. Orcutt?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span></p>

<p>The tone was one of surprise. Mr. Gryce's little
finger seemed to take note of it, for it tapped the leg
beneath it in quite an emphatic manner as he continued:
"It was in answer to a question put to him by Miss
Dare. To the surprise of every one, she had not left
him from the moment they were mutually relieved from
the weight of the fallen limb, but had stood over him for
hours, watching for him to rouse from his insensibility.
When he did, she appealed to him in a way that showed
she expected a reply, to tell her who it was that killed
the Widow Clemmens."</p>

<p>"And did Mr. Orcutt know?" was Mansell's half-agitated,
half-incredulous query.</p>

<p>"His answer seemed to show that he did. Mr. Mansell,
have you ever had any doubts of Mr. Orcutt?"</p>

<p>"Doubts?"</p>

<p>"Doubts as to his integrity, good-heartedness, or desire
to serve you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You will, then, be greatly surprised," Mr. Gryce went
on, with increased gravity, "when I tell you that Mr.
Orcutt's reply to Miss Dare's question was such as to
draw attention to himself as the assassin of Widow Clemmens,
and that his words and the circumstances under
which they were uttered have so impressed Mr. Ferris,
that the question now agitating his mind is not, 'Is Craik
Mansell innocent, but was his counsel, Tremont Orcutt,
guilty?'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span></p>

<p>The excited look which had appeared on the face of
Mansell at the beginning of this speech, changed to one
of strong disgust.</p>

<p>"This is too much!" he cried. "I am not a fool to be
caught by any such make-believe as this! Mr. Orcutt
thought to be an assassin? You might as well say
that people accuse Judge Evans of killing the Widow
Clemmens."</p>

<p>Mr. Gryce, who had perhaps stretched a point when
he so unequivocally declared his complete confidence in
the innocence of the man before him, tapped his leg
quite affectionately at this burst of natural indignation,
and counted off another point in favor of the prisoner.
His words, however, were dry as sarcasm could make
them.</p>

<p>"No," said he, "for people know that Judge Evans
was without the opportunity for committing this murder,
while every one remembers how Mr. Orcutt went to the
widow's house and came out again with tidings of her
death."</p>

<p>The prisoner's lip curled disdainfully.</p>

<p>"And do you expect me to believe you regard this as
a groundwork for suspicion? I should have given you
credit for more penetration, sir."</p>

<p>"Then you do not think Mr. Orcutt knew what he
was saying when, in answer to Miss Dare's appeal for him
to tell who the murderer was, he answered: 'Blood will
have blood!' and drew attention to his own violent
end?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did Mr. Orcutt say that?"</p>

<p>"He did."</p>

<p>"Very well, a man whose whole mind has for some
time been engrossed with defending another man accused
of murder, might say any thing while in a state of
delirium."</p>

<p>Mr. Gryce uttered his favorite "Humph!" and gave
his leg another pat, but added, gravely enough: "Miss
Dare believes his words to be those of confession."</p>

<p>"You say Miss Dare once believed me to have confessed."</p>

<p>"But," persisted the detective, "Miss Dare is not
alone in her opinion. Men in whose judgment you must
rely, find it difficult to explain the words of Mr. Orcutt
by means of any other theory than that he is himself the
perpetrator of that crime for which you are yourself
being tried."</p>

<p>"I find it difficult to believe that possible," quietly
returned the prisoner. "What!" he suddenly exclaimed;
"suspect a man of Mr. Orcutt's abilities and standing of
a hideous crime&mdash;the very crime, too, with which his
client is charged, and in defence of whom he has brought
all his skill to bear! The idea is preposterous, unheard
of!"</p>

<p>"I acknowledge that," dryly assented Mr. Gryce;
"but it has been my experience to find that it is the
preposterous things which happen."</p>

<p>For a minute the prisoner stared at the speaker incredulously;
then he cried:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span></p>

<p>"You really appear to be in earnest."</p>

<p>"I was never more so in my life," was Mr. Gryce's
rejoinder.</p>

<p>Drawing back, Craik Mansell looked at the detective
with an emotion that had almost the character of hope.
Presently he said:</p>

<p>"If you do distrust Mr. Orcutt, you must have weightier
reasons for it than any you have given me. What are
they? You must be willing I should know, or you would
not have gone as far with me as you have."</p>

<p>"You are right," Gryce assured him. "A case so complicated
as this calls for unusual measures. Mr. Ferris,
feeling the gravity of his position, allows me to take you
into our confidence, in the hope that you will be able to
help us out of our difficulty."</p>

<p>"I help you! You'd better release me first."</p>

<p>"That will come in time."</p>

<p>"<i>If</i> I help you?"</p>

<p>"Whether you help or not, if we can satisfy ourselves
and the world that Mr. Orcutt's words were a confession.
You may hasten that conviction."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"By clearing up the mystery of your flight from Mrs.
Clemmens' house."</p>

<p>The keen eyes of the prisoner fell; all his old distrust
seemed on the point of returning.</p>

<p>"That would not help you at all," said he.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> should like to be the judge," said Mr. Gryce.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span></p>

<p>The prisoner shook his head.</p>

<p>"My word must go for it," said he.</p>

<p>The detective had been the hero of too many such
scenes to be easily discouraged. Bowing as if accepting
this conclusion from the prisoner, he quietly proceeded
with the recital he had planned. With a frankness certainly
unusual to him, he gave the prisoner a full account
of Mr. Orcutt's last hours, and the interview which had
followed between himself and Miss Dare. To this he added
his own reasons for doubting the lawyer, and, while
admitting he saw no motive for the deed, gave it as his
serious opinion, that the motive would be found if once he
could get at the secret of Mr. Orcutt's real connection with
the deceased. He was so eloquent, and so manifestly in
earnest, Mr. Mansell's eye brightened in spite of himself,
and when the detective ceased he looked up with an expression
which convinced Mr. Gryce that half the battle
was won. He accordingly said, in a tone of great
confidence:</p>

<p>"A knowledge of what went on in Mrs. Clemmens'
house before he went to it would be of great help to us.
With that for a start, all may be learned. I therefore put
it to you for the last time whether it would not be best for
you to explain yourself on this point. I am sure you will
not regret it."</p>

<p>"Sir," said Mansell, with undisturbed composure, "if
your purpose is to fix this crime on Mr. Orcutt, I must
insist upon your taking my word that I have no information
to give you that can in any way affect him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span></p>

<p>"You could give us information, then, that would affect
Miss Dare?" was the quick retort. "Now, I say," the
astute detective declared, as the prisoner gave an almost
imperceptible start, "that whatever your information is,
Miss Dare is not guilty."</p>

<p>"You say it!" exclaimed the prisoner. "What does
your opinion amount to if you haven't heard the evidence
against her?"</p>

<p>"There is no evidence against her but what is purely
circumstantial."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?"</p>

<p>"Because she is innocent. Circumstantial evidence may
exist alike against the innocent and the guilty; real evidence
only against the guilty. I mean to say that as I
am firmly convinced Miss Dare once regarded you as
guilty of this crime, I must be equally convinced she
didn't commit it herself. This is unanswerable."</p>

<p>"You have stated that before."</p>

<p>"I know it; but I want you to see the force of it; because,
once convinced with me that Miss Dare is innocent,
you will be willing to tell all you know, even what apparently
implicates her."</p>

<p>Silence answered this remark.</p>

<p>"You didn't <i>see</i> her strike the blow?"</p>

<p>Mansell roused indignantly.</p>

<p>"No, of course not!" he cried.</p>

<p>"You did not see her with your aunt that moment you
fled from the house immediately before the murder!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span></p>

<p>"I didn't <i>see</i> her."</p>

<p>That emphasis, unconscious, perhaps, was fatal. Gryce,
who never lost any thing, darted on this small gleam of
advantage as a hungry pike darts upon an innocent
minnow.</p>

<p>"But you thought you heard her," he cried; "her
voice, or her laugh, or perhaps merely the rustle of her
dress in another room?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mansell, "I didn't <i>hear</i> her."</p>

<p>"Of course not," was the instantaneous reply. "But
something said or done by somebody&mdash;a something
which amounts to nothing as evidence&mdash;gives you to
understand she was there, and so you hold your tongue
for fear of compromising her."</p>

<p>"Amounts to nothing as evidence?" echoed Mansell.
"How do you know that?"</p>

<p>"Because Miss Dare was not in the house with your
aunt at that time. Miss Dare was in Professor Darling's
observatory, a mile or so away."</p>

<p>"Does she say that?"</p>

<p>"We will <i>prove</i> that."</p>

<p>Aroused, excited, the prisoner turned his flashing blue
eyes on the detective.</p>

<p>"I should be glad to have you," he said.</p>

<p>"But you must first tell me in what room you were
when you received this intimation of Miss Dare's presence?"</p>

<p>"I was in no room; I was on the stone step outside of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
the dining-room door. I did not go into the house at all
that morning, as I believe I have already told Mr.
Ferris."</p>

<p>"<i>Very</i> good! It will all be simpler than I thought.
You came up to the house and went away again without
coming in; ran away, I may say, taking the direction of
the swamp."</p>

<p>The prisoner did not deny it.</p>

<p>"You remember all the incidents of that short flight?"</p>

<p>The prisoner's lip curled.</p>

<p>"Remember leaping the fence and stumbling a trifle
when you came down?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Very well; now tell me how could Miss Dare see you
do that from Mrs. Clemmens' house?"</p>

<p>"Did Miss Dare tell you she saw me trip after I
jumped the fence?"</p>

<p>"She did."</p>

<p>"And yet was in Professor Darling's observatory, a
mile or so away?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>A satirical laugh broke from the prisoner.</p>

<p>"I think," said he, "that instead of my telling you
how she could have seen this from Mrs. Clemmens' house,
you should tell me how she could have seen it from Professor
Darling's observatory."</p>

<p>"That is easy enough. She was looking through a
telescope."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span></p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"At the moment you were turning from Mrs. Clemmens'
door, Miss Dare, perched in the top of Professor
Darling's house, was looking in that very direction
through a telescope."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I would like to believe that story," said the
prisoner, with suppressed emotion. "It would&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" urged the detective, calmly.</p>

<p>"Make a new man of me," finished Mansell, with a
momentary burst of feeling.</p>

<p>"Well, then, call up your memories of the way your
aunt's house is situated. Recall the hour, and acknowledge
that, if Miss Dare was with her, she must have been
in the dining-room."</p>

<p>"There is no doubt about that."</p>

<p>"Now, how many windows has the dining-room?"</p>

<p>"One."</p>

<p>"How situated?"</p>

<p>"It is on the same side as the door."</p>

<p>"There is none, then, which looks down to that place
where you leaped the fence?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"How account for her seeing that little incident, then,
of your stumbling?"</p>

<p>"She might have come to the door, stepped out, and
so seen me."</p>

<p>"Humph! I see you have an answer for every
thing."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span></p>

<p>Craik Mansell was silent.</p>

<p>A look of admiration slowly spread itself over the detective's
face.</p>

<p>"We must probe the matter a little deeper," said he.
"I see I have a hard head to deal with." And, bringing
his glance a little nearer to the prisoner, he remarked:</p>

<p>"If she had been standing there you could not have
turned round without seeing her?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Now, did you see her standing there?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Yet you turned round?"</p>

<p>"I did?"</p>

<p>"Miss Dare says so."</p>

<p>The prisoner struck his forehead with his hand.</p>

<p>"And it <i>is</i> so," he cried. "I remember now that some
vague desire to know the time made me turn to look
at the church clock. Go on. Tell me more that Miss
Dare saw."</p>

<p>His manner was so changed&mdash;his eye burned so brightly&mdash;the
detective gave himself a tap of decided self-gratulation.</p>

<p>"She saw you hurry over the bog, stop at the entrance
of the wood, take a look at your watch, and plunge with
renewed speed into the forest."</p>

<p>"It is so. It is so. And, to have seen that, she must
have had the aid of a telescope."</p>

<p>"Then she describes your appearance. She says you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
had your pants turned up at the ankles, and carried your
coat on your left arm."</p>

<p>"<i>Left</i> arm?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I think I had it on my right."</p>

<p>"It was on the arm toward her, she declares. If she
was in the observatory, it was your left side that she
saw."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; but the coat was over the other arm. I
remember using my left hand in vaulting over the fence
when I came up to the house."</p>

<p>"It is a vital point," said Mr. Gryce, with a quietness
that concealed his real anxiety and chagrin. "If the
coat was on the arm <i>toward</i> her, the fact of its being on
the right&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait!" exclaimed Mr. Mansell, with an air of sudden
relief. "I recollect now that I changed it from one
arm to the other after I vaulted the fence. It was just at
the moment I turned to come back to the side door, and,
as she does not pretend to have seen me till after I left
the door, of course the coat was, as she says, on my left
arm."</p>

<p>"I thought you could explain it," returned Mr. Gryce,
with an air of easy confidence. "But what do you mean
when you say that you changed it at the moment you
turned to come back to the side door? Didn't you go
at once to the dining-room door from the swamp?"</p>

<p>"No. I had gone to the front door on my former<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
visit, and was going to it this time; but when I got to
the corner of the house I saw the tramp coming into the
gate, and not wishing to encounter any one, turned
round and came back to the dining-room door."</p>

<p>"I see. And it was then you heard&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What I heard," completed the prisoner, grimly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mansell," said the other, "are you not sufficiently
convinced by this time that Miss Dare was not with
Mrs. Clemmens, but in the observatory of Professor Darling's
house, to tell me what that was?"</p>

<p>"Answer me a question and I will reply. Can the
entrance of the woods be seen from the position which
she declares herself to have occupied?"</p>

<p>"It can. Not two hours ago I tried the experiment
myself, using the same telescope and kneeling in the
same place where she did. I found I could not only
trace the spot where you paused, but could detect quite
readily every movement of my man Hickory, whom I had
previously placed there to go through the motions. I
should not have come here if I had not made myself certain
on that point."</p>

<p>Yet the prisoner hesitated.</p>

<p>"I not only made myself sure of that," resumed Mr.
Gryce, "but I also tried if I could see as much with my
naked eye from Mrs. Clemmens' side door. I found I
could not, and my sight is very good."</p>

<p>"Enough," said Mansell; "hard as it is to explain, I
must believe Miss Dare was not where I thought her."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then you will tell me what you heard?"</p>

<p>"Yes; for in it may lie the key to this mystery, though
how, I cannot see, and doubt if you can. I am all the
more ready to do it," he pursued, "because I can now
understand how she came to think me guilty, and, thinking
so, conducted herself as she has done from the beginning
of my trial. All but the fact of her denouncing
herself yesterday; that I cannot comprehend."</p>

<p>"A woman in love can do any thing," quoth Mr. Gryce.
Then admonished by the flush of the prisoner's cheek
that he was treading on dangerous ground, he quickly
added: "But she will explain all that herself some day.
Let us hear what you have to tell me."</p>

<p>Craik Mansell drooped his head and his brow became
gloomy.</p>

<p>"Sir," said he, "it is unnecessary for me to state that
your surmise in regard to my past convictions is true. If
Miss Dare was not with my aunt just before the murder,
I certainly had reasons for thinking she was. To be sure,
I did not see her or hear her voice, but I heard my aunt
address her distinctly and by name."</p>

<p>"You did?" Mr. Gryce's interest in the tattoo he
was playing on his knee became intense.</p>

<p>"Yes. It was just as I pushed the door ajar. The
words were these: 'You think you are going to marry
him, Imogene Dare; but I tell you you <i>never shall</i>, not
while <i>I</i> live.'"</p>

<p>"Humph!" broke involuntarily from the detective's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
lips, and, though his face betrayed nothing of the shock
this communication occasioned him, his fingers stopped
an instant in their restless play.</p>

<p>Mr. Mansell saw it and cast him an anxious look. The
detective instantly smiled with great unconcern. "Go
on," said he, "what else did you hear?"</p>

<p>"Nothing else. In the mood in which I was this very
plain intimation that Miss Dare had sought my aunt, had
pleaded with her for me and failed, struck me as sufficient.
I did not wait to hear more, but hurried away in
a state of passion that was little short of frenzy. To
leave the place and return to my work was now my one
wish. When I found, then, that by running I might
catch the train at Monteith, I ran, and so unconsciously
laid myself open to suspicion."</p>

<p>"I see," murmured the detective; "I see."</p>

<p>"Not that I suspected any evil then," pursued Mr.
Mansell, earnestly. "I was only conscious of disappointment
and a desire to escape from my own thoughts. It
was not till next day&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes," interrupted Mr. Gryce, abstractedly,
"but your aunt's words! She said: 'You think you are
going to marry him, Imogene Dare; but you never shall,
not while I live.' Yet Imogene Dare was not there. Let
us solve that problem."</p>

<p>"You think you can?"</p>

<p>"I think I must."</p>

<p>"How? how?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span></p>

<p>The detective did not answer. He was buried in profound
thought. Suddenly he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"It is, as you say, the key-note to the tragedy. It must
be solved." But the glance he dived deep into space
seemed to echo that "How? how?" of the prisoner, with
a gloomy persistence that promised little <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'sor'">for</ins> an immediate
answer to the enigma before them. It occurred to
Mansell to offer a suggestion.</p>

<p>"There is but one way <i>I</i> can explain it," said he.
"My aunt was speaking to herself. She was deaf and
lived alone. Such people often indulge in soliloquizing."</p>

<p>The slap which Mr. Gryce gave his thigh must have
made it tingle for a good half-hour.</p>

<p>"There," he cried, "who says extraordinary measures
are not useful at times? You've hit the very explanation.
Of course she was speaking to herself. She was
just the woman to do it. Imogene Dare was in her
thoughts, so she addressed Imogene Dare. If you had
opened the door you would have seen her standing there
alone, venting her thoughts into empty space."</p>

<p>"I wish I had," said the prisoner.</p>

<p>Mr. Gryce became exceedingly animated. "Well,
that's settled," said he. "Imogene Dare was not there,
save in Mrs. Clemmens' imagination. And now for the
conclusion. She said: 'You think you are going to
marry him, Imogene Dare; but you never shall, not while
I live.' That shows her mind was running on you."</p>

<p>"It shows more than that. It shows that, if Miss Dare<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
was not with her then, she must have been there earlier
in the day. For, when I left my aunt the day before, she
was in entire ignorance of my attachment to Miss Dare,
and the hopes it had led to."</p>

<p>"Say that again," cried Gryce.</p>

<p>Mr. Mansell repeated himself, adding: "That would
account for the ring being found on my aunt's dining-room
floor&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Mr. Gryce waved that question aside.</p>

<p>"What I want to make sure of is that your aunt
had not been informed of your wishes as concerned Miss
Dare."</p>

<p>"Unless Miss Dare was there in the early morning and
told her herself."</p>

<p>"There were no neighbors to betray you?"</p>

<p>"There wasn't a neighbor who knew any thing about
the matter."</p>

<p>The detective's eye brightened till it vied in brilliancy
with the stray gleam of sunshine which had found its
way to the cell through the narrow grating over their
heads.</p>

<p>"A clue!" he murmured; "I have received a clue,"
and rose as if to leave.</p>

<p>The prisoner, startled, rose also.</p>

<p>"A clue to what?" he cried.</p>

<p>But Mr. Gryce was not the man to answer such a
question.</p>

<p>"You shall hear soon. Enough that you have given<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
me an idea that may eventually lead to the clearing up of
this mystery, if not to your own acquittal from a false
charge of murder."</p>

<p>"And Miss Dare?"</p>

<p>"Is under no charge, and never will be."</p>

<p>"And Mr. Orcutt?"</p>

<p>"Wait," said Mr. Gryce&mdash;"wait."</p>

<h2>XLI.</h2>

<h3>A LINK SUPPLIED.</h3>

<div class='poem'>
Upon his bloody finger he doth wear<br />
A precious ring.<br />

<div class='sig'>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Titus Andronicus.</span><br /></div>
<br />


Make me to see it; or at the least so prove it,<br />
That the probation bear no hinge nor loop<br />
To hang a doubt on.<br />
<br />
<div class='sig'>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Othello.</span><br /></div>
<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>MR. GRYCE did not believe that Imogene Dare
had visited Mrs. Clemmens before the assault,
or, indeed, had held any communication with her. Therefore,
when Mansell declared that he had never told
his aunt of the attachment between himself and this
young lady, the astute detective at once drew the conclusion
that the widow had never known of that attachment,
and consequently that the words which the prisoner had
overheard must have referred, not to himself, as he
supposed, but to some other man, and, if to some other
man&mdash;why to the only one with whom Miss Dare's name
was at that time associated; in other words, to Mr.
Orcutt!</div>

<p>Now it was not easy to measure the importance of
a conclusion like this. For whilst there would have been
nothing peculiar in this solitary woman, with the few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
thousands in the bank, boasting of her power to separate
her nephew from the lady of his choice, there was every
thing that was significant in her using the same language
in regard to Miss Dare and Mr. Orcutt. Nothing but
the existence of some unsuspected bond between herself
and the great lawyer could have accounted, first, for her
feeling on the subject of his marriage; and, secondly, for
the threat of interference contained in her very emphatic
words,&mdash;a bond which, while evidently not that of love,
was still of a nature to give her control over his destiny,
and make her, in spite of her lonely condition, the selfish
and determined arbitrator of his fate.</p>

<p>What was that bond? A secret shared between them?
The knowledge on her part of some fact in Mr. Orcutt's
past life, which, if revealed, might serve as an impediment
to his marriage? In consideration that the great mystery
to be solved was what motive Mr. Orcutt could have had
for killing this woman, an answer to this question was
manifestly of the first importance.</p>

<p>But before proceeding to take any measures to insure
one, Mr. Gryce sat down and seriously asked himself
whether there was any known fact, circumstantial or
otherwise, which refused to fit into the theory that
Mr. Orcutt actually committed this crime with his own
hand, and at the time he was seen to cross the street and
enter Mrs. Clemmens' house. For, whereas the most
complete chain of circumstantial evidence does not
necessarily prove the suspected party to be guilty of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
crime, the least break in it is fatal to his conviction.
And Mr. Gryce wished to be as fair to the memory
of Mr. Orcutt as he would have been to the living
man.</p>

<p>Beginning, therefore, with the earliest incidents of the
fatal day, he called up, first, the letter which the widow
had commenced but never lived to finish. It was a suggestive
epistle. It was addressed to her most intimate
friend, and showed in the few lines written a certain foreboding
or apprehension of death remarkable under the
circumstances. Mr. Gryce recalled one of its expressions.
"There are so many," wrote she, "to whom my
death would be more than welcome." So many! Many
is a strong word; many means more than one, more than
two; many means <i>three</i> at least. Now where were the
three? Hildreth, of course, was one, Mansell might
very properly be another, but who was the third? To
Mr. Gryce, but one name suggested itself in reply. So
far, then, his theory stood firm. Now what was the next
fact known? The milkman stopped with his milk; that
was at half-past eleven. He had to wait a few minutes,
from which it was concluded she was up-stairs when he
rapped. Was it at this time she was interrupted in her
letter-writing? If so, she probably did not go back to it,
for when Mr. Hildreth called, some fifteen minutes later,
she was on the spot to open the door. Their interview
was short; it was also stormy. Medicine was the last
thing she stood in need of; besides, her mind was evidently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>
preoccupied. Showing him the door, she goes
back to her work, and, being deaf, does not notice that
he does not leave the house as she expected. Consequently
her thoughts go on unhindered, and, her condition
being one of anger, she mutters aloud and bitterly to
herself as she flits from dining-room to kitchen in her
labor of serving up her dinner. The words she made use
of have been overheard, and here another point appears.
For, whereas her temper must have been disturbed by
the demand which had been made upon her the day
before by her favorite relative and heir, her expressions
of wrath at this moment were not levelled against him,
but against a young lady who is said to have been a
stranger to her, her language being: "You think you are
going to marry him, Imogene Dare; but I tell you you
never shall, not while I live." Her chief grievance, then,
and the one thing uppermost in her thoughts, even at a
time when she felt that there were many who desired her
death, lay in this fact that a young and beautiful woman
had manifested, as she supposed, a wish to marry Mr.
Orcutt, the word <i>him</i> which she had used, necessarily referring
to the lawyer, as she knew nothing of Imogene's
passion for her nephew.</p>

<p>But this is not the only point into which it is necessary
to inquire. For to believe Mr. Orcutt guilty of this
crime one <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'most'">must</ins> also believe that all the other persons
who had been accused of it were truthful in the explanations
which they gave of the events which had seemingly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>
connected them with it. Now, were they? Take the
occurrences of that critical moment when the clock stood
at five minutes to twelve. If Mr. Hildreth is to be believed,
he was at that instant in the widow's front hall
musing on his disappointment and arranging his plans
for the future; the tramp, if those who profess to have
watched him are to be believed, was on the kitchen
portico; Craik Mansell on the dining-room door-step;
Imogene Dare before her telescope in Professor Darling's
observatory. Mr. Hildreth, with two doors closed between
him and the back of the house, knew nothing of
what was said or done there, but the tramp heard loud
talking, and Craik Mansell the actual voice of the widow
raised in words which were calculated to mislead him
into thinking she was engaged in angry altercation with
the woman he loved. What do all three do, then? Mr.
Hildreth remains where he is; the tramp skulks away
through the front gate; Craik Mansell rushes back to
the woods. And Imogene Dare? She has turned her
telescope toward Mrs. Clemmens' cottage, and, being
on the side of the dining-room door, sees the flying form
of Craik Mansell, and marks it till it disappears from her
sight. Is there any thing contradictory in these various
statements? No. Every thing, on the contrary, that is
reconcilable.</p>

<p>Let us proceed then. What happens a few minutes
later? Mr. Hildreth, tired of seclusion and anxious to
catch the train, opens the front door and steps out. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
tramp, skulking round some other back door, does not
see him; Imogene, with her eye on Craik Mansell, now
vanishing into the woods, does not see him; nobody sees
him. He goes, and the widow for a short interval is as
much alone as she believed herself to be a minute or two
before when three men stood, unseen by each other, at
each of the three doors of her house. What does she do
now?</p>

<p>Why, she finishes preparing her dinner, and then,
observing that the clock is slow, proceeds to set it right.
Fatal task! Before she has had an opportunity to finish
it, the front door has opened again, Mr. Orcutt has come
in, and, tempted perhaps by her defenceless position,
catches up a stick of wood from the fireplace and, with
one blow, strikes her down at his feet, and rushes forth
again with tidings of her death.</p>

<p>Now, is there any thing in all <i>this</i> that is contradictory?
No; there is only something left out. In the whole of
this description of what went on in the widow's house,
there has been no mention made of the ring&mdash;the ring
which it is conceded was either in Craik Mansell's or
Imogene Dare's possession the evening before the murder,
and which was found on the dining-room floor within ten
minutes after the assault took place. If Mrs. Clemmens'
exclamations are to be taken as an attempt to describe
her murderer, then this ring must have been on the hand
which was raised against her, and how could that have
been if the hand was that of Mr. Orcutt? Unimportant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>
as it seemed, the discovery of this ring on the floor, taken
with the exclamations of the widow, make a break in the
chain that is fatal to Mr. Gryce's theory. Yet does it?
The consternation displayed by Mr. Orcutt when Imogene
claimed the ring and put it on her finger may have
had a deeper significance than was thought at the time.
Was there any way in which he could have come into
possession of it before she did? and could it have been
that he had had it on his hand when he struck the blow?
Mr. Gryce bent all his energies to inquire.</p>

<p>First, where was the ring when the lovers parted in the
wood the day before the murder? Evidently in Mr.
Mansell's coat-pocket. Imogene had put it there, and
Imogene had left it there. But Mansell did not know it
was there, so took no pains to look after its safety. It
accordingly slipped out; but when? Not while he slept,
or it would have been found in the hut. Not while he
took the path to his aunt's house, or it would have been
found in the lane, or, at best, on the dining-room door-step.
When, then? Mr. Gryce could think of but one
instant, and that was when the young man threw his
coat from one arm to the other at the corner of the house
toward the street. If it rolled out then it would have
been under an impetus, and, as the coat was flung from
the right arm to the left, the ring would have flown in the
direction of the gate and fallen, perhaps, directly on the
walk in front of the house. If it had, its presence in the
dining-room seemed to show it had been carried there by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>
Mr. Orcutt, since he was the next person who went into
the house.</p>

<p>But did it fall there? Mr. Gryce took the only available
means to find out.</p>

<p>Sending for Horace Byrd, he said to him:</p>

<p>"You were on the court-house steps when Mr. Orcutt
left and crossed over to the widow's house?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Were you watching him? Could you describe his
manner as he entered the house; how he opened the
gate; or whether he stopped to look about him before
going in?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," returned Byrd; "my eyes may have been on
him, but I don't remember any thing especial that he did."</p>

<p>Somewhat disappointed, Mr. Gryce went to the District
Attorney and put to him the same question. The
answer he received from him was different. With a
gloomy contraction of his brow, Mr. Ferris said:</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember his look and appearance very well.
He stepped briskly, as he always did, and carried
his head&mdash;&mdash; Wait!" he suddenly exclaimed, giving the
detective a look in which excitement and decision were
strangely blended. "You think Mr. Orcutt committed
this crime; that he left us standing on the court-house
steps and crossed the street to Mrs. Clemmens' house
with the deliberate intention of killing her, and leaving
the burden of his guilt to be shouldered by the tramp.
Now, you have called up a memory to me that convinces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>
me this could not have been. Had he had any such infernal
design in his breast he would not have been likely
to have stopped as he did to pick up something which he
saw lying on the walk in front of Mrs. Clemmens' house."</p>

<p>"And did Mr. Orcutt do that?" inquired Mr. Gryce,
with admirable self-control.</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember it now distinctly. It was just as he
entered the gate. A man meditating a murder of this
sort would not be likely to notice a pin lying in his path,
much less pause to pick it up."</p>

<p>"How if it were a diamond ring?"</p>

<p>"A diamond ring?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Ferris," said the detective, gravely, "you have
just supplied a very important link in the chain of evidence
against Mr. Orcutt. The question is, how could
the diamond ring which Miss Dare is believed to have
dropped into Mr. Mansell's coat-pocket have been carried
into Mrs. Clemmens' house without the agency of either
herself or Mr. Mansell? I think you have just shown."
And the able detective, in a few brief sentences, explained
the situation to Mr. Ferris, together with the circumstances
of Mansell's flight, as gleaned by him in his conversation
with the prisoner.</p>

<p>The District Attorney was sincerely dismayed. The
guilt of the renowned lawyer was certainly assuming positive
proportions. Yet, true to his friendship for Mr. Orcutt,
he made one final effort to controvert the arguments
of the detective, and quietly said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span></p>

<p>"You profess to explain how the ring might have been
carried into Mrs. Clemmens' house, but how do you
account for the widow having used an exclamation
which seems to signify it was <i>on</i> the hand which she
saw lifted against her life?"</p>

<p>"By the fact that it was on that hand."</p>

<p>"Do you think that probable if the hand was Mr.
Orcutt's?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly so. Where else would he be likely to put
it in the preoccupied state of mind in which he was? In
his pocket? The tramp might have done that, but not
the gentleman."</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris looked at the detective with almost an expression
of fear.</p>

<p>"And how came it to be on the floor if Mr. Orcutt put
it on his finger?"</p>

<p>"By the most natural process in the world. The ring
made for Miss Dare's third finger was too large for
Mr. Orcutt's little finger, and so slipped off when he
dropped the stick of wood from his hand."</p>

<p>"And he left it lying where it fell?"</p>

<p>"He probably did not notice its loss. If, as I suppose,
he had picked it up and placed it on his finger,
mechanically, its absence at such a moment would not be
observed. Besides, what clue could he suppose a
diamond ring he had never seen before, and which he
had had on his finger but an instant, would offer in
a case like this?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span></p>

<p>"You reason close," said the District Attorney; "too
close," he added, as he recalled, with painful distinctness,
the look and attitude of Mr. Orcutt at the time this
ring was first brought into public notice, and realized that
so might a man comport himself who, conscious of this
ring's association with the crime he had just secretly perpetrated,
sees it claimed and put on the finger of the woman
he loves.</p>

<p>Mr. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Gyrce'">Gryce</ins>, with his usual intuition, seemed to follow
the thoughts of the District Attorney.</p>

<p>"If our surmises are correct," he remarked, "it was a
grim moment for the lawyer when, secure in his immunity
from suspicion, he saw Miss Dare come upon the scene
with eager inquiries concerning this murder. To you,
who had not the clue, it looked as if he feared she was
not as innocent as she should be; but, if you will recall
the situation now, I think you will see that his agitation
can only be explained by his apprehension of her
intuitions and an alarm lest her interest sprang from some
mysterious doubt of himself."</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris shook his head with a gloomy air, but
did not respond.</p>

<p>"Miss Dare tells me," the detective resumed, "that his
first act upon their meeting again at his house was to
offer himself to her in marriage. Now you, or any one
else, would say this was to show he did not mistrust her,
but I say it was to find out if she mistrusted him."</p>

<p>Still Mr. Ferris remained silent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span></p>

<p>"The same reasoning will apply to what followed,"
continued Mr. Gryce. "You cannot reconcile the
thought of his guilt with his taking the case of Mansell
and doing all he could to secure his acquittal. But you
will find it easier to do so when I tell you that, without
taking into consideration any spark of sympathy which he
might feel for the man falsely accused of his crime, he
knew from Imogene's lips that she would not survive the
condemnation of her lover, and that, besides this, his
only hope of winning her for his wife lay in the gratitude
he might awaken in her if he succeeded in saving his
rival."</p>

<p>"You are making him out a great villain," murmured
Mr. Ferris, bitterly.</p>

<p>"And was not that the language of his own countenance
as he lay dying?" inquired the detective.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris could not say No. He had himself been
too deeply impressed by the sinister look he had observed
on the face of his dying friend. He therefore confined
himself to remarking, not without sarcasm:</p>

<p>"And now for the motive of this hideous crime&mdash;for I
suppose your ingenuity has discovered one before this."</p>

<p>"It will be found in his love for Miss Dare," returned
the detective; "but just how I am not prepared to-day
to say."</p>

<p>"His love for Miss Dare? What had this plain and
homespun Mrs. Clemmens to do with his love for
Miss Dare?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span></p>

<p>"She was an interference."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Ah, that, sir, is the question."</p>

<p>"So then you do not know?"</p>

<p>Mr. Gryce was obliged to shake his head.</p>

<p>The District Attorney drew himself up. "Mr. Gryce,"
said he, "the charge which has been made against this
eminent man demands the very strongest proof in order
to substantiate it. The motive, especially, must be shown
to have been such as to offer a complete excuse for suspecting
him. No trivial or imaginary reason for his
wishing this woman out of the world will answer in his case.
You must prove that her death was absolutely necessary to
the success of his dearest hopes, or your reasoning will
only awaken distrust in the minds of all who hear it.
The fame of a man like Mr. Orcutt is not to be destroyed
by a passing word of delirium, or a specious display of
circumstantial evidence such as you evolve from the presence
of the ring on the scene of murder."</p>

<p>"I know it," allowed Mr. Gryce, "and that is why I
have asked for a week."</p>

<p>"Then you still believe you can find such a motive?"</p>

<p>The smile which Mr. Gryce bestowed upon the favored
object then honored by his gaze haunted the District Attorney
for the rest of the week.</p>

<h2>XLII.</h2>

<h3>CONSULTATIONS.</h3>

<div class='poem'>
That he should die is worthy policy;<br />
But yet we want a color for his death;<br />
'Tis meet he be condemned by course of law.<br />

<div class='sig'>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Henry VI.</span><br /></div>
<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>MR. GRYCE was perfectly aware that the task
before him was a difficult one. To be himself
convinced that Mr. Orcutt had been in possession of a
motive sufficient to account for, if not excuse, this horrible
crime was one thing; to find out that motive and
make it apparent to the world was another. But he was
not discouraged. Summoning his two subordinates, he
laid the matter before them.</div>

<p>"I am convinced," said he, "that Mrs. Clemmens was
a more important person to Mr. Orcutt than her plain appearance
and humble manner of life would suggest. Do
either of you know whether Mr. Orcutt's name has ever
been associated with any private scandal, the knowledge
of which might have given her power over him?"</p>

<p>"I do not think he was that kind of a man," said
Byrd. "Since morning I have put myself in the way of
such persons as I saw disposed to converse about him,
and though I have been astonished to find how many
there are who say they never quite liked or altogether<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
trusted this famous lawyer, I have heard nothing said in
any way derogatory to his private character. Indeed, I
believe, as far as the ladies were concerned, he was particularly
reserved. Though a bachelor, he showed no
disposition to marry, and until Miss Dare appeared on
the scene was not known to be even attentive to one of
her sex."</p>

<p>"Some one, however, I forget who, told me that for a
short time he was sweet on a certain Miss Pratt," remarked
Hickory.</p>

<p>"Pratt? Where have I heard that name?" murmured
Byrd to himself.</p>

<p>"But nothing came of it," Hickory continued. "She
was not over and above smart they say, and though
pretty enough, did not hold his fancy. Some folks declare
she was so disappointed she left town."</p>

<p>"Pratt, Pratt!" repeated Byrd to himself. "Ah! I
know now," he suddenly exclaimed. "While I stood
around amongst the crowd, the morning Mrs. Clemmens
was murdered, I remember overhearing some one say
how hard she was on the Pratt girl."</p>

<p>"Humph!" ejaculated Mr. Gryce. "The widow was
hard on any one Mr. Orcutt chose to admire."</p>

<p>"I don't understand it," said Byrd.</p>

<p>"Nor I," rejoined Mr. Gryce; "but I intend to before
the week is out." Then abruptly: "When did Mrs.
Clemmens come to this town?"</p>

<p>"Fifteen years ago," replied Byrd.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span></p>

<p>"And Orcutt&mdash;when did he first put in an appearance
here?"</p>

<p>"At very much the same time, I believe."</p>

<p>"Humph! And did they seem to be friends at that
time?"</p>

<p>"Some say Yes, some say No."</p>

<p>"Where did he come from&mdash;have you learned?"</p>

<p>"From some place in Nebraska, I believe."</p>

<p>"And she?"</p>

<p>"Why, she came from some place in Nebraska too!"</p>

<p>"The <i>same</i> place?"</p>

<p>"That we must find out."</p>

<p>Mr. Gryce mused for a minute; then he observed:</p>

<p>"Mr. Orcutt was renowned in his profession. Do you
know any thing about his career&mdash;whether he brought a
reputation for ability with him, or whether his fame was
entirely made in this place?"</p>

<p>"I think it was made here. Indeed, I have heard that
it was in this court he pleaded his first case. Don't you
know more about it, Hickory?"</p>

<p>"Yes; Mr. Ferris told me this morning that Orcutt
had not opened a law-book when he came to this town.
That he was a country schoolmaster in some uncivilized
district out West, and would never have been any thing
more, perhaps, if the son of old Stephen Orcutt had not
died, and thus made a vacancy in the law-office here
which he was immediately sent for to fill."</p>

<p>"Stephen Orcutt? He was the uncle of this man,
wasn't he?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And quite a lawyer too?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but nothing like Tremont B. <i>He</i> was successful
from the start. Had a natural aptitude, I suppose&mdash;must
have had, to pick up the profession in the way he did."</p>

<p>"Boys," cried Mr. Gryce, after another short ruminative
pause, "the secret we want to know is of long standing;
indeed, I should not be surprised if it were connected
with his life out West. I will tell you why I think
so. For ten years Mrs. Clemmens has been known to
put money in the bank regularly every week. Now,
where did she get that money? From Mr. Orcutt, of
course. What for? In payment for the dinner he usually
took with her? No, in payment of her silence concerning
a past he desired kept secret."</p>

<p>"But they have been here fifteen years and she has
only received money for ten."</p>

<p>"She has only put money in the bank for ten; she
may have been paid before that and may not. I do not
suppose he was in a condition to be very lavish at the
outset of his career."</p>

<p>"You advise us, then, to see what we can make out of
his early life out West?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and I will see what I can make out of hers.
The link which connects the two will be found. Mr.
Orcutt did not say: 'It was all for you, Imogene,' for
nothing."</p>

<p>And, dismissing the two young men, Mr. Gryce proceeded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span>
to the house of Mr. Orcutt, where he entered
upon an examination of such papers and documents as
were open to his inspection, in the hope of discovering
some allusion to the deceased lawyer's early history.
But he was not successful. Neither did a like inspection
of the widow's letters bring any new facts to light. The
only result which seemed to follow these efforts was an
increased certainty on his part that some dangerous secret
lurked in a past that was so determinedly hidden from
the world, and resorting to the only expedient now left to
him, he resolved to consult Miss Firman, as being the
only person who professed to have had any acquaintance
with Mrs. Clemmens before she came to Sibley. To be
sure, she had already been questioned by the coroner,
but Mr. Gryce was a man who had always found that the
dryest well could be made to yield a drop or two more of
water if the bucket was dropped by a dexterous hand.
He accordingly prepared himself for a trip to Utica.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span></p>
<h2>XLIII.</h2>

<h3>MRS. FIRMAN.</h3>

<div class='poem'>
Hark! she speaks. I will set down what comes from her....<br />
Heaven knows what she has known.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Macbeth.</span><br />
<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>"MISS FIRMAN, I believe?" The staid, pleasant-faced
lady whom we know, but who is looking
older and considerably more careworn than when we
saw her at the coroner's inquest, rose from her chair
in her own cozy sitting-room, and surveyed her visitor
curiously. "I am Mr. Gryce," the genial voice went on.
"Perhaps the name is not familiar?"</div>

<p>"I never heard it before," was the short but not
ungracious reply.</p>

<p>"Well, then, let me explain," said he. "You are a
relative of the Mrs. Clemmens who was so foully murdered
in Sibley, are you not? Pardon me, but I see you
are; your expression speaks for itself." How he could
have seen her expression was a mystery to Miss Firman,
for his eyes, if not attention, were seemingly fixed upon
some object in quite a different portion of the room.
"You must, therefore," he pursued, "be in a state
of great anxiety to know who her murderer was. Now,
I am in that same state, madam; we are, therefore,
in sympathy, you see."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span></p>

<p>The respectful smile and peculiar intonation with
which these last words were uttered, robbed them of
their familiarity and allowed Miss Firman to perceive his
true character.</p>

<p>"You are a detective," said she, and as he did not
deny it, she went on: "You say I must be anxious to
know who my cousin's murderer was. Has Craik Mansell,
then, been acquitted?"</p>

<p>"A verdict has not been given," said the other. "His
trial has been adjourned in order to give him an opportunity
to choose a new counsel."</p>

<p>Miss Firman motioned her visitor to be seated, and at
once took a chair herself.</p>

<p>"What do you want with me?" she asked, with characteristic
bluntness.</p>

<p>The detective was silent. It was but for a moment,
but in that moment he seemed to read to the bottom of
this woman's mind.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "I will tell you. You believe Craik
Mansell to be innocent?"</p>

<p>"I do," she returned.</p>

<p>"Very well; so do I."</p>

<p>"Let me shake hands with you," was her abrupt remark.
And without a smile she reached forth her hand,
which he took with equal gravity.</p>

<p>This ceremony over, he remarked, with a cheerful
mien:</p>

<p>"We are fortunately not in a court of law, and so can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[575]</a></span>
talk freely together. Why do you think Mansell innocent?
I am sure the evidence has not been much
in his favor."</p>

<p>"Why do <i>you</i> think him innocent?" was the brisk
retort.</p>

<p>"I have talked with him."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>"I have talked with Miss Dare."</p>

<p>A different "Ah!" this time.</p>

<p>"And I was present when Mr. Orcutt breathed his
last."</p>

<p>The look she gave was like cold water on Mr. Gryce's
secretly growing hopes.</p>

<p>"What has that to do with it?" she wonderingly exclaimed.</p>

<p>The detective took another tone.</p>

<p>"You did not know Mr. Orcutt then?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"I had not that honor," was the formal reply.</p>

<p>"You have never, then, visited your cousin in
Sibley?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I was there once; but that did not give me an
acquaintance with Mr. Orcutt."</p>

<p>"Yet he went almost every day to her house."</p>

<p>"And he came while I was there, but <i>that</i> did not give
me an acquaintance with him."</p>

<p>"He was reserved, then, in his manners, uncommunicative,
possibly morose?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span></p>

<p>"He was just what I would expect such a gentleman
to be at the table with women like my cousin
and myself."</p>

<p>"Not morose, then; only reserved."</p>

<p>"Exactly," the short, quick bow of the amiable spinster
seemed to assert.</p>

<p>Mr. Gryce drew a deep breath. This well seemed to
be destitute of even a drop of moisture.</p>

<p>"Why do you ask me about Mr. Orcutt? Has his
death in any way affected young Mansell's prospects?"</p>

<p>"That is what I want to find out," declared Mr.
Gryce. Then, without giving her time for another question,
said: "Where did Mrs. Clemmens first make the
acquaintance of Mr. Orcutt? Wasn't it in some town
out West?"</p>

<p>"Out West? Not to my knowledge, sir. I always
supposed she saw him first in Sibley."</p>

<p>This well was certainly very dry.</p>

<p>"Yet you are not positive that this is so, are you?"
pursued the patient detective. "She came from Nebraska,
and so did he; now, why may they not have
known each other there?"</p>

<p>"I did not know that he came from Nebraska."</p>

<p>"She has never talked about him then?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>Mr. Gryce drew another deep breath and let down his
bucket again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[577]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thought your cousin spent her childhood in
Toledo?"</p>

<p>"She did, sir."</p>

<p>"How came she to go to Nebraska then?"</p>

<p>"Well, she was left an orphan and had to look out for
herself. A situation in some way opened to her in Nebraska,
and she went there to take it."</p>

<p>"A situation at what?"</p>

<p>"As waitress in some hotel."</p>

<p>"Humph! And was she still a waitress when she
married?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so, but I am not sure about it or any
thing else in connection with her at that time. The subject
was so painful we never discussed it."</p>

<p>"Why painful?"</p>

<p>"She lost her husband so soon."</p>

<p>"But you can tell me the name of the town in which
this hotel was, can you not?"</p>

<p>"It was called Swanson then, but that was fifteen
years ago. Its name may have been changed since."</p>

<p>Swanson! This was something to learn, but not much.
Mr. Gryce returned to his first question. "You have
not told me," said he, "why <i>you</i> believe Craik Mansell
to be innocent?"</p>

<p>"Well," replied she, "<i>I</i> believe Craik Mansell to be
innocent because he is the son of his mother. I think I
know <i>him</i> pretty well, but I am certain I knew <i>her</i>. She
was a woman who would go through fire and water to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span>
attain a purpose she thought right, but who would stop
in the midst of any project the moment she felt the least
doubt of its being just or wise. Craik has his mother's
forehead and eyes, and no one will ever make me believe
he has not her principles also."</p>

<p>"I coincide with you, madam," remarked the attentive
detective.</p>

<p>"I hope the jury will," was her energetic response.</p>

<p>He bowed and was about to attempt another question,
when an interruption occurred. Miss Firman was called
from the room, and Mr. Gryce found himself left for a
few moments alone. His thoughts, as he awaited her
return, were far from cheerful, for he saw a long and
tedious line of inquiry opening before him in the West,
which, if it did not end in failure, promised to exhaust
not only a week, but possibly many months, before certainty
of any kind could be obtained. With Miss Dare
on the verge of a fever, and Mansell in a position calling
for the utmost nerve and self-control, this prospect
looked any thing but attractive to the benevolent detective;
and, carried away by his impatience, he was about
to give utterance to an angry ejaculation against the man
he believed to be the author of all this mischief, when he
suddenly heard a voice raised from some unknown quarter
near by, saying in strange tones he was positive did
not proceed from Miss Firman:</p>

<p>"Was it Clemmens or was it Orcutt? Clemmens or
Orcutt? I cannot remember."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span></p>

<p>Naturally excited and aroused, Mr. Gryce rose and
looked about him. A door stood ajar at his back.
Hastening toward it, he was about to lay his hand on
the knob when Miss Firman returned.</p>

<p>"Oh, I beg you," she entreated. "That is my
mother's room, and she is not at all well."</p>

<p>"I was going to her assistance," asserted the detective,
with grave composure. "She has just uttered a
cry."</p>

<p>"Oh, you don't say so!" exclaimed the unsuspicious
spinster, and hurrying forward, she threw open the door
herself. Mr. Gryce benevolently followed. "Why, she
is asleep," protested Miss Firman, turning on the detective
with a suspicious look.</p>

<p>Mr. Gryce, with a glance toward the bed he saw before
him, bowed with seeming perplexity.</p>

<p>"She certainly appears to be," said he, "and yet I am
positive she spoke but an instant ago; I can even tell you
the words she used."</p>

<p>"What were they?" asked the spinster, with something
like a look of concern.</p>

<p>"She said: 'Was it Clemmens or was it Orcutt? Clemmens
or Orcutt? I cannot remember.'"</p>

<p>"You don't say so! Poor ma! She was dreaming.
Come into the other room and I will explain."</p>

<p>And leading the way back to the apartment they had
left, she motioned him again toward a chair, and then
said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ma has always been a very hale and active woman for
her years; but this murder seems to have shaken her. To
speak the truth, sir, she has not been quite right in her
mind since the day I told her of it; and I often detect
her murmuring words similar to those you have just
heard."</p>

<p>"Humph! And does she often use his name?"</p>

<p>"Whose name?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Orcutt's."</p>

<p>"Why, yes; but not with any understanding of whom
she is speaking."</p>

<p>"Are you <i>sure?</i>" inquired Mr. Gryce, with that peculiar
impressiveness he used on great occasions.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean," returned the detective, dryly, "that I believe
your mother does know what she is talking about when
she links the name of Mr. Orcutt with that of your cousin
who was murdered. They belong together; Mr. Orcutt
was her murderer."</p>

<p>"<i>Mr. Orcutt?</i>"</p>

<p>"Hush!" cried Mr. Gryce, "you will wake up your
mother."</p>

<p>And, adapting himself to this emergency as to all others,
he talked with the astounded and incredulous woman
before him till she was in a condition not only to listen to
his explanations, but to discuss the problem of a crime so
seemingly without motive. He then said, with easy assurance:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your mother does not know that Mr. Orcutt is
dead?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"She does not even know he was counsel for Craik
Mansell in the trial now going on."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?" inquired Miss Firman,
grimly.</p>

<p>"Because I do not believe you have even told her that
Craik Mansell was on trial."</p>

<p>"Sir, you are a magician."</p>

<p>"Have you, madam?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I have not."</p>

<p>"Very good; what <i>does</i> she know about Mr. Orcutt,
then; and why should she connect his name with Mrs.
Clemmens?"</p>

<p>"She knows he was her boarder, and that he was the
first one to discover she had been murdered."</p>

<p>"That is not enough to account for her frequent repetition
of his name."</p>

<p>"You think not?"</p>

<p>"I am sure not. Cannot your mother have some
memories connected with his name of which you are ignorant?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; we have lived together in this house for
twenty-five years, and have never had a thought we have
not shared together. Ma could not have known any
thing about him or Mary Ann which I did not. The
words she has just spoken sprang from mental confusion.
She is almost like a child sometimes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Gryce smiled. If the cream-jug he happened to
be gazing at on a tray near by had been full of cream, I
am far from certain it would not have turned sour on the
spot.</p>

<p>"I grant the mental confusion," said he; "but why
should she confuse those two names in preference to all
others?" And, with quiet persistence, he remarked again:
"She may be recalling some old fact of years ago. Was
there never a time, even while you lived here together,
when she could have received some confidence from Mrs.
Clemmens&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mary Ann, Mary Ann!" came in querulous accents
from the other room, "I wish you had not told me; Emily
would be a better one to know your secret."</p>

<p>It was a startling interruption to come just at that moment
The two surprised listeners glanced toward each
other, and Miss Firman colored.</p>

<p>"That sounds as if your surmise was true," she dryly
observed.</p>

<p>"Let us make an experiment," said he, and motioned
her to re-enter her mother's room, which she did with a
precipitation that showed her composure had been sorely
shaken by these unexpected occurrences.</p>

<p>He followed her without ceremony.</p>

<p>The old lady lay as before in a condition between
sleeping and waking, and did not move as they came in.
Mr. Gryce at once withdrew out of sight, and, with finger
on his lip, put himself in the attitude of waiting. Miss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[583]</a></span>
Firman, surprised, and possibly curious, took her stand
at the foot of the bed.</p>

<p>A few minutes passed thus, during which a strange
dreariness seemed to settle upon the room; then the old
lady spoke again, this time repeating the words he had
first heard, but in a tone which betrayed an increased
perplexity.</p>

<p>"<i>Was</i> it Clemmens or <i>was</i> it Orcutt? I wish somebody
would tell me."</p>

<p>Instantly Mr. Gryce, with his soft tread, drew near to
the old lady's side, and, leaning over her, murmured
gently:</p>

<p>"I think it was Orcutt."</p>

<p>Instantly the old lady breathed a deep sigh and moved.</p>

<p>"Then her name was Mrs. Orcutt," said she, "and I
thought you always called her Clemmens."</p>

<p>Miss Firman, recoiling, stared at Mr. Gryce, on whose
cheek a faint spot of red had appeared&mdash;a most unusual
token of emotion with him.</p>

<p>"Did she say it was Mrs. Orcutt," he pursued, in the
even tones he had before used.</p>

<p>"She said&mdash;&mdash;" But here the old lady opened her
eyes, and, seeing her daughter standing at the foot of her
bed, turned away with a peevish air, and restlessly pushed
her hand under the pillow.</p>

<p>Mr. Gryce at once bent nearer.</p>

<p>"She said&mdash;&mdash;" he suggested, with careful gentleness.</p>

<p>But the old lady made no answer. Her hand seemed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[584]</a></span>
to have touched some object for which she was seeking,
and she was evidently oblivious to all else. Miss Firman
came around and touched Mr. Gryce on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"It is useless," said she; "she is awake now, and you
won't hear any thing more; come!"</p>

<p>And she drew the reluctant detective back again into
the other room.</p>

<p>"What does it all mean?" she asked, sinking into a
chair.</p>

<p>Mr. Gryce did not answer. He had a question of his
own to put.</p>

<p>"Why did your mother put her hand under her pillow?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know, unless it was to see if her big envelope
was there."</p>

<p>"Her big envelope?"</p>

<p>"Yes; for weeks now, ever since she took to her bed,
she has kept a paper in a big envelope under her pillow.
What is in it I don't know, for she never seems to hear
me when I inquire."</p>

<p>"And have you no curiosity to find out?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. Why should I? It might easily be my
father's old letters sealed up, or, for that matter, be nothing
more than a piece of blank paper. My mother is not
herself, as I have said before."</p>

<p>"I should like a peep at the contents of that envelope,"
he declared.</p>

<p>"You?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[585]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is there any name written on the outside?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"It would not be violating any one's rights, then, if
you opened it."</p>

<p>"Only my mother's, sir."</p>

<p>"You say she is not in her right mind?"</p>

<p>"All the more reason why I should respect her whims
and caprices."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you open it if she were dead?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Will it be very different then from what it is now?
A father's letters! a blank piece of paper! What harm
would there be in looking at them?"</p>

<p>"My mother would know it if I took them away. It
might excite and injure her."</p>

<p>"Put another envelope in the place of this one, with a
piece of paper folded up in it."</p>

<p>"It would be a trick."</p>

<p>"I know it; but if Craik Mansell can be saved even by
a trick, I should think you would be willing to venture
on one."</p>

<p>"Craik Mansell? What has he got to do with the
papers under my mother's pillow?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say that he has any thing to do with them;
but if he has&mdash;if, for instance, that envelope should contain,
not a piece of blank paper, or even the letters of
your father, but such a document, say, as a certificate of
marriage&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span></p>

<p>"A certificate of marriage?"</p>

<p>"Yes, between Mrs. Clemmens and Mr. Orcutt, it
would not take much perspicacity to prophesy an
acquittal for Craik Mansell."</p>

<p>"Mary Ann the wife of Mr. Orcutt! Oh, that is impossible!"
exclaimed the agitated spinster. But even
while making this determined statement, she turned a
look full of curiosity and excitement toward the door
which separated them from her mother's apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. Gryce smiled in his wise way.</p>

<p>"Less improbable things than that have been found to
be true in this topsy-turvy world," said he. "Mrs. Clemmens
might very well have been Mrs. Orcutt."</p>

<p>"Do you really think so?" she asked; and yielding with
sudden impetuosity to the curiosity of the moment, she
at once dashed from his side and disappeared in her
mother's room. Mr. Gryce's smile took on an aspect of
triumph.</p>

<p>It was some few moments before she returned, but
when she did, her countenance was flushed with emotion.</p>

<p>"I have it," she murmured, taking out a packet from
under her apron and tearing it open with trembling
fingers.</p>

<p>A number of closely written sheets fell out.</p>

<h2>XLIV.</h2>

<h3>THE WIDOW CLEMMENS.</h3>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Discovered</span><br />
The secret that so long had hovered<br />
Upon the misty verge of Truth.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Longfellow.</span><br />
<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>"WELL, and what have you to say?" It was Mr.
Ferris who spoke. The week which Mr.
Gryce had demanded for his inquiries had fully elapsed,
and the three detectives stood before him ready with
their report.</div>

<p>It was Mr. Gryce who replied.</p>

<p>"Sir," said he, "our opinions have not been changed
by the discoveries which we have made. It was Mr.
Orcutt who killed Mrs. Clemmens, and for the reason
already stated that she stood in the way of his marrying
Miss Dare. Mrs. Clemmens was his wife."</p>

<p>"His <i>wife?</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; and, what is more, she has been so for
years; before either of them came to Sibley, in fact."</p>

<p>The District Attorney looked stunned.</p>

<p>"It was while they lived West," said Byrd. "He was
a poor school-master, and she a waitress in some hotel.
She was pretty then, and he thought he loved her. At
all events, he induced her to marry him, and then kept it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[588]</a></span>
secret because he was afraid she would lose her place at
the hotel, where she was getting very good wages. You
see, he had the makings in him of a villain even then."</p>

<p>"And was it a real marriage?"</p>

<p>"There is a record of it," said Hickory.</p>

<p>"And did he never acknowledge it?"</p>

<p>"Not openly," answered Byrd. "The commonness of
the woman seemed to revolt him after he was married to
her, and when in a month or so he received the summons
East, which opened up before him the career of a lawyer,
he determined to drop her and start afresh. He accordingly
left town without notifying her, and actually succeeded
in reaching the railway depot twenty miles away
before he was stopped. But here, a delay occurring in
the departure of the train, she was enabled to overtake
him, and a stormy scene ensued. What its exact nature
was, we, of course, cannot say, but from the results it is
evident that he told her his prospects had changed, and
with them his tastes and requirements; that she was not
the woman he thought her, and that he could not and
would not take her East with him as his wife: while she,
on her side, displayed full as much spirit as he, and replied
that if he could desert her like this he wasn't the
kind of a man she could live with, and that he could go
if he wished; only that he must acknowledge her claims
upon him by giving her a yearly stipend, according to
his income and success. At all events, some such compromise
was effected, for he came East and she went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[589]</a></span>
back to Swanson. She did not stay there long, however;
for the next we know she was in Sibley, where she set up
her own little house-keeping arrangements under his very
eye. More than that, she prevailed upon him to visit her
daily, and even to take a meal at her house, her sense of
justice seeming to be satisfied if he showed her this little
attention and gave to no other woman the place he
denied her. It was the weakness shown in this last requirement
that doubtless led to her death. She would
stand any thing but a rival. He knew this, and preferred
crime to the loss of the woman he loved."</p>

<p>"You speak very knowingly," said Mr. Ferris. "May
I ask where you received your information?"</p>

<p>It was Mr. Gryce who answered.</p>

<p>"From letters. Mrs. Clemmens was one of those women
who delight in putting their feelings on paper. Fortunately
for us, such women are not rare. See here!"
And he pulled out before the District Attorney a pile of
old letters in the widow's well-known handwriting.</p>

<p>"Where did you find these?" asked Mr. Ferris.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Gryce, "I found them in rather
a curious place. They were in the keeping of old Mrs.
Firman, Miss Firman's mother. Mrs. Clemmens, or,
rather, Mrs. Orcutt, got frightened some two years ago at
the disappearance of her marriage certificate from the
place where she had always kept it hidden, and, thinking
that Mr. Orcutt was planning to throw her off, she
resolved to provide herself with a confidante capable of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[590]</a></span>
standing by her in case she wished to assert her rights.
She chose old Mrs. Firman. Why, when her daughter
would have been so much more suitable for the purpose,
it is hard to tell; possibly the widow's pride revolted
from telling a woman of her own years the indignities
she had suffered. However that may be, it was to
the old lady she told her story and gave these letters&mdash;letters
which, as you will see, are not written to any
special person, but are rather the separate leaves of
a journal which she kept to show the state of her feelings
from time to time."</p>

<p>"And this?" inquired Mr. Ferris, taking up a sheet
of paper written in a different handwriting from the
rest.</p>

<p>"This is an attempt on the part of the old lady to put
on paper the story which had been told her. She evidently
thought herself too old to be entrusted with a secret
so important, and, fearing loss of memory, or perhaps
sudden death, took this means of explaining how she
came into possession of her cousin's letters. 'T was a
wise precaution. Without it we would have missed the
clue to the widow's journal. For the old lady's brain
gave way when she heard of the widow's death, and had
it not been for a special stroke of good-luck on my
part, we might have remained some time longer in
ignorance of what very valuable papers she secretly held
in her possession."</p>

<p>"I will read the letters," said Mr. Ferris.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[591]</a></span></p>

<p>Seeing from his look that he only waited their departure
to do so, Mr. Gryce and his <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'surbordinates'">subordinates</ins> arose.</p>

<p>"I think you will find them satisfactory," drawled
Hickory.</p>

<p>"If you do not," said Mr. Gryce, "then give a look at
this telegram. It is from Swanson, and notifies us that a
record of a marriage between Benjamin Orcutt&mdash;Mr.
Orcutt's middle name was Benjamin&mdash;and Mary Mansell
can be found in the old town books."</p>

<p>Mr. Ferris took the telegram, the shade of sorrow settling
heavier and heavier on his brow.</p>

<p>"I see," said he, "I have got to accept your conclusions.
Well, there are those among the living who
will be greatly relieved by these discoveries. I will try
and think of that."</p>

<p>Yet, after the detectives were gone, and he sat down in
solitude before these evidences of his friend's perfidy, it
was many long and dreary moments before he could summon
up courage to peruse them. But when he did, he
found in them all that Mr. Gryce had promised. As my
readers may feel some interest to know how the seeming
widow bore the daily trial of her life, I will give a few
extracts from these letters. The first bears date of fourteen
years back, and was written after she came to
Sibley:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">November 8, 1867.</span>&mdash;In the same town! Within a
stone's throw of the court-house, where, they tell me, his
business will soon take him almost every day! Isn't it
a triumph? and am I not to be congratulated upon my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[592]</a></span>
bravery in coming here? He hasn't seen me yet, but I
have seen <i>him</i>. I crept out of the house at nightfall on
purpose. He was sauntering down the street and he
looked&mdash;it makes my blood boil to think of it&mdash;he looked
<i>happy</i>."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">November 10, 1867.</span>&mdash;Clemmens, Clemmens&mdash;that
is my name, and I have taken the title of widow.
What a fate for a woman with a husband in the next
street! He saw <i>me</i> to-day. I met him in the open
square, and I looked him right in the face. How he did
quail! It just does me good to think of it! Perk and
haughty as he is, he grew as white as a sheet when he saw
me, and though he tried to put on airs and carry it off
with a high hand, he failed, just as I knew he would
when he came to meet me on even ground. Oh, I'll
have my way now, and if I choose to stay in this place
where I can keep my eye on him, he won't dare to say
No. The only thing I fear is that he will do me a secret
mischief some day. His look was just murderous when
he left me."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">February 24, 1868.</span>&mdash;Can I stand it? I ask myself
that question every morning when I get up. Can I stand
it? To sit all alone in my little narrow room and know
that he is going about as gay as you please with people
who wouldn't look at me twice. It's awful hard; but
it would be worse still to be where I couldn't see what
he was up to. Then I should imagine all sorts of things.
No, I will just grit my teeth and bear it. I'll get used
to it after a while."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">October 7, 1868.</span>&mdash;If he says he never loved me he
lies. He did, or why did he marry me? I never asked
him to. He teased me into it, saying my saucy ways had
bewitched him. A month after, it was common ways,
rude ways, such ways as he wouldn't have in a wife.
That's the kind of man he is."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">May 11, 1869.</span>&mdash;One thing I will say of him. He
don't pay no heed to women. He's too busy, I guess.
He don't seem to think of any thing but to get along,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[593]</a></span>
and he does get along remarkable. I'm awful proud of
him. He's taken to defending criminals lately. They
almost all get off."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">October 5, 1870.</span>&mdash;He pays me but a pittance. How
can I look like any thing, or hold my head up with the
ladies here if I cannot get enough together to buy me a
new fall hat. I <i>will</i> not go to church looking like a
farmer's wife, if I haven't any education or any manners.
I'm as good as anybody here if they but knew it,
and deserve to dress as well. He <i>must</i> give me more
money."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">November 2, 1870.</span>&mdash;No, he sha'n't give me a
cent more. If I can't go to church I will stay at home.
He sha'n't say I stood in his way of becoming a
great man. He <i>is</i> too good for me. I saw it to-day
when he got up in the court to speak. I was there
with a thick veil over my face, for I was determined
to know whether he was as smart as folks say or not.
And he just is! Oh, how beautiful he did look, and
how everybody held their breaths while he was speaking!
I felt like jumping up and saying: 'This is my
husband; we were married three years ago.' Wouldn't
I have raised a rumpus if I had! I guess the poor
man he was pleading for would not have been remembered
very long after that. My husband! the thought
makes me laugh. No other woman can call him that,
anyhow. He is mine, <i>mine</i>, <i>mine</i>, and I mean he shall
stay so."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">January 9, 1871.</span>&mdash;I feel awful blue to-night. I
have been thinking about those Hildreths. How they
would like to have me dead! And so would Tremont,
though he don't say nothing. I like to call him Tremont;
it makes me feel as if he belonged to me. What if that
wicked Gouverneur Hildreth should know I lived so much
alone? I don't believe he would stop at killing me! And
my husband! He is equal to telling him I have no protector.
Oh, what a dreadful wickedness it is in me to put
that down on paper! It isn't so&mdash;it isn't so; my husband<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[594]</a></span>
wouldn't do me any harm if he could. If ever I'm found
dead in my bed, it will be the work of that Toledo man
and of nobody else."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">March 2, 1872.</span>&mdash;I hope I am going to have some
comfort now. Tremont has begun to pay me more
money. He <i>had</i> to. He isn't a poor man any more,
and when he moves into his big house, I am going to move
into a certain little cottage I have found, just around the
corner. If I can't have no other pleasures, I will at least
have a kitchen I can call my own, and a parlor too.
What if there don't no company come to it; they would
if they <i>knew</i>. I've just heard from Adelaide; she says
Craik is getting to be a big boy, and is so smart."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">June 10, 1872.</span>&mdash;What's the use of having a home? I
declare I feel just like breaking down and crying. I don't
want company: if women folks, they're always talking
about their husbands and children; and if men, they're
always saying: 'My wife's this, and my wife's that.'
But I do want <i>him</i>. It's my right; what if I couldn't
say three words to him that was agreeable, I could look
at him and think: 'This splendid gentleman is my husband,
I ain't so much alone in the world as folks think.'
I'll put on my bonnet and run down the street. Perhaps
I'll see him sitting in the club-house window!"</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Evening.</span>&mdash;I hate him. He has a hard, cruel, wicked
heart. When I got to the club-house window he was sitting
there, so I just went walking by, and he saw me and
came out and hustled me away with terrible words, saying
he wouldn't have me hanging round where he was; that
I had promised not to bother him, and that I must keep my
word, or he would see me&mdash;he didn't say where, but it's
easy enough to guess. So&mdash;so! he thinks he'll put an
end to my coming to see him, does he? Well, perhaps he
can; but if he does, he shall pay for it by coming to see
me. I'll not sit day in and day out alone without the
glimpse of a face I love, not while I have a husband in
the same town with me. He shall come, if it is only for
a moment each day, or I'll dare every thing and tell the
world I am his wife."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[595]</a></span></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">June 16, 1872.</span>&mdash;He had to consent! Meek as I
have been, he knows it won't do to rouse me too much.
So to-day he came in to dinner, and he had to acknowledge
it was a good one. Oh, how I did feel when I saw
his face on the other side of the table! I didn't know
whether I hated him or loved him. But I am sure now I
hated him, for he scarcely spoke to me all the time he was
eating, and when he was through, he went away just as a
stranger would have done. He means to act like a boarder,
and, goodness me, he's welcome to if he isn't going to
act like a husband! The hard, selfish&mdash;&mdash; Oh, oh, I
love him!"</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">August 5, 1872.</span>&mdash;It is no use; I'll never be a
happy woman. Tremont has been in so regularly to dinner
lately, and shown me such a kind face, I thought I
would venture upon a little familiarity. It was only to lay
my hand upon his arm, but it made him very angry, and I
thought he would strike me. Am I then actually hateful
to him? or is he so proud he cannot bear the thought of
my having the right to touch him? I looked in the glass
when he went out. I <i>am</i> plain and homespun, that's a
fact. Even my red cheeks are gone, and the dimples
which once took his fancy. I shall never lay the tip of
a finger on him again."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">February 13, 1873.</span>&mdash;What shall I cook for him
to-day? Some thing that he likes. It is my only pleasure,
to see how he does enjoy my meals. I should think
they would choke him; they do me sometimes. But men
are made of iron&mdash;ambitious men, anyhow. Little they
care what suffering they cause, so long as they have a
good time and get all the praises they want. <i>He</i> gets them
more and more every day. He will soon be as far above
me as if I had married the President himself. Oh, sometimes
when I think of it and remember he is my own husband,
I just feel as if some awful fate was preparing for
him or me!"</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">June 7, 1873.</span>&mdash;Would he send for me if he was
dying? No. He hates me; he hates me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[596]</a></span></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">September 8, 1874.</span>&mdash;Craik was here to-day; he is
just going North to earn a few dollars in the logging business.
What a keen eye he has for a boy of his years! I
shouldn't wonder if he made a powerful smart man some
day. If he's only good, too, and kind to his women-folks,
I sha'n't mind. But a smart man who is all
for himself is an awful trial to those who love him.
Don't I know? Haven't I suffered? Craik must never
be like him."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">December 21, 1875.</span>&mdash;One thousand dollars. That's
a nice little sum to have put away in the bank. So
much I get out of my husband's fame, anyhow. I
think I will make my will, for I want Craik to have what
I leave. He's a fine lad."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">February 19, 1876.</span>&mdash;I was thinking the other day,
suppose I did die suddenly. It would be dreadful to
have the name of Clemmens put on my tombstone! But
it would be. Tremont would never let the truth be
known, if he had to rifle my dead body for my marriage
certificate. What shall I do, then? Tell anybody who
I am? It seems just as if I couldn't. Either the whole
world must know it, or just himself and me alone. Oh, I
wish I had never been born!"</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">June 17, 1876.</span>&mdash;Why wasn't I made handsome
and fine and nice? Think where I would be if I was!
I'd be in that big house of his, curtesying to all the
grand folks as go there. I went to see it last night. It
was dark as pitch in the streets, and I went into the gate
and all around the house. I walked upon the piazza too,
and rubbed my hand along the window-ledges and up
and down the doors. It's mighty nice, all of it, and
there sha'n't lie a square inch on that whole ground that
my foot sha'n't go over. I wish I could get inside the
house once."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">July 1, 1876.</span>&mdash;I have done it. I went to see Mr.
Orcutt's sister. I had a right. Isn't he away, and
isn't he my boarder, and didn't I want to know when
he was coming home? She's a soft, good-natured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[597]</a></span>
piece, and let me peek into the library without saying a
word. What a room it is! I just felt like I'd been
struck when I saw it and spied his chair setting there
and all those books heaped around and the fine things on
the mantel-shelf and the pictures on the walls. What
would I do in such a place as that? I could keep it
clean, but so could any gal he might hire. Oh, me! Oh,
me! I wish he'd given me a chance. Perhaps if he had
loved me I might have learned to be quiet and nice like
that silly sister of his."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">January 12, 1877.</span>&mdash;Some women would take a
heap of delight in having folks know they were the
wife of a great man, but I find lots of pleasure in being
so without folks knowing it. If I lived in his big house
and was called Mrs. Orcutt, why, he would have nothing
to be afraid of and might do as he pleased; but
now he has to do what <i>I</i> please. Sometimes, when I sit
down of an evening in my little sitting-room to sew, I
think how this famous man whom everybody is afraid of
has to come and go just as humble me wants him to;
and it makes me hug myself with pride. It's as if I
had a string tied round his little finger, which I can pull
now and then. I don't pull it much; but I do sometimes."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">March 30, 1877.</span>&mdash;Gouverneur Hildreth is dead. I
shall never be his victim, at any rate. Shall I ever be the
victim of anybody? I don't feel as if I cared now. For
one kiss I would sell my life and die happy.</p>

<p>"There is a young Gouverneur, but it will be years
before he will be old enough to make me afraid of
him."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">November 16, 1878.</span>&mdash;I should think that Tremont
would be lonely in that big house of his. If he
had a heart he would. They say he reads all the time.
How can folks pore so over books? I can't. I'd
rather sit in my chair and think. What story in all the
books is equal to mine?"</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">April 23, 1879.</span>&mdash;I am growing very settled in my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[598]</a></span>
ways. Now that Tremont comes in almost every day,
I'm satisfied not to see any other company. My house
affairs keep me busy too. I like to have it all nice for
him. I believe I could almost be happy if he'd only
smile once in a while when he meets my eye. But he
never does. Oh, well, we all have our crosses, and he's
a very great man."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">January 18, 1880.</span>&mdash;He went to a ball last night.
What does it mean? He never seemed to care for
things like that. Is there any girl he is after?"</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">February 6, 1880.</span>&mdash;Oh, he has been riding with
a lady, has he? It was in the next town, and he thought
I wouldn't hear. But there's little he does that I don't
know about; let him make himself sure of that. I even
know her name; it is Selina Pratt. If he goes with her
again, look out for a disturbance. I'll not stand his
making love to another woman."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">May 26, 1880.</span>&mdash;My marriage certificate is missing.
Can it be that Tremont has taken it? I have looked all
through the desk where I have kept it for so many years,
but I cannot find it. He was left alone in the house a
few minutes the other day. Could he have taken the
chance to rob me of the only proof I have that we are
man and wife? If he has he is a villain at heart, and is
capable of doing any thing, even of marrying this Pratt
girl who he <i>has</i> taken riding again. The worst is that I
dare not accuse him of having my certificate; for if he
didn't take it and should find out it is gone, he'd throw
me off just as quick as if he had. What shall I do then?
Something. He shall <i>never</i> marry another woman while
I live."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">May 30, 1880.</span>&mdash;The Pratt girl is gone. If he
cared for her it was only for a week, like an old love I
could mention. I think I feel safe again, only I am convinced
some one ought to know my secret besides myself.
Shall it be Emily? No. I'd rather tell her mother."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">June 9th, 1880.</span>&mdash;I am going to Utica. I shall take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[599]</a></span>
these letters with me. Perhaps I shall leave them. For
the last time, then, let me say 'I am the lawful wife of
Tremont Benjamin Orcutt, the lawyer, who lives in Sibley,
New York.' We were married in Swanson, Nevada,
on the 3d of July, 1867, by a travelling minister, named
George Sinclair.</p>

<h2>XLV.</h2>

<h3>MR. GRYCE SAYS GOOD-BYE.</h3>

<div class='center'>
There still are many rainbows in your sky.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Byron.</span><br />
<br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>"HELEN?"</div>

<p>"Yes, Imogene."</p>

<p>"What noise is that? The people seem to be shouting
down the street. What does it mean?"</p>

<p>Helen Richmond&mdash;whom we better know as Helen
Darling&mdash;looked at the worn, fever-flushed countenance
of her friend, and for a moment was silent; then she
whispered:</p>

<p>"I have not dared to tell you before, you seemed so
ill; but I can tell you now, because joyful news never
hurts. The people shout because the long and tedious
trial of an innocent man has come to an end. Craik
Mansell was acquitted from the charge of murder this
morning."</p>

<p>"Acquitted! O Helen!"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear. Since you have been ill, very strange
and solemn revelations have come to light. Mr. Orcutt&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried Imogene, rising up in the great arm-chair
in which she was half-sitting and half-reclining.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[601]</a></span>
"I know what you are going to say. I was with Mr.
Orcutt when he died. I heard him myself declare that
fate had spoken in his death. I believe Mr. Orcutt to
have been the murderer of Mrs. Clemmens, Helen."</p>

<p>"Yes, there can be no doubt about that," was the
reply.</p>

<p>"It has been proved then?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Moved to the depths of her being, Imogene covered
her face with her hands. Presently she murmured:</p>

<p>"I do not understand it. Why should such a great
man as he have desired the death of a woman like her?
He said it was all for my sake. What did he mean,
Helen?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know?" questioned the other, anxiously.</p>

<p>"How should I? It is the mystery of mysteries to
me."</p>

<p>"Ah, then you did not suspect that she was his
wife?"</p>

<p>"His wife!" Imogene rose in horror.</p>

<p>"Yes," repeated the little bride with decision. "She
was his lawfully wedded wife. They were married as
long ago as when we were little children."</p>

<p>"Married! And he dared to approach me with words
of love! Dared to offer himself to me as a husband
while his hands were still wet with the life-blood of his
wife! O the horror of it! The amazing wickedness
and presumption of it!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[602]</a></span></p>

<p>"He is dead," whispered the gentle little lady at her
side.</p>

<p>With a sigh of suppressed feeling, Imogene sank back.</p>

<p>"I must not think of him," she cried. "I am not
strong enough. I must think only of Craik. He has
been acquitted, you say&mdash;acquitted."</p>

<p>"Yes, and the whole town is rejoicing."</p>

<p>A smile, exquisite as it was rare, swept like a sunbeam
over Imogene's lips.</p>

<p>"And I rejoice with the rest," she cried. Then, as if
she felt all speech to be a mockery, she remained for a
long time silent, gazing with ever-deepening expression
into the space before her, till Helen did not know
whether the awe she felt creeping over her sprang from
admiration of her companion's suddenly awakened beauty
or from a recognition of the depths of that companion's
emotions. At last Imogene spoke:</p>

<p>"How came Mr. Mansell to be <i>acquitted?</i> Mr. Gryce
did not tell me to look for any such reinstatement as
that. The most he bade me expect was that Mr. Ferris
would decline to prosecute Mr. Mansell any further, in
which event he would be discharged."</p>

<p>"I know," said Helen, "but Mr. Mansell was not satisfied
with that. He demanded a verdict from the jury.
So Mr. Ferris, with great generosity, asked the Judge to
recommend the jury to bring in a verdict of acquittal,
and when the Judge hesitated to do this, the foreman of
the jury himself rose, and intimated that he thought the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[603]</a></span>
jury were ready with their verdict. The Judge took advantage
of this, and the result was a triumphant acquittal."</p>

<p>"O Helen, Helen!"</p>

<p>"That was just an hour ago," cried the little lady,
brightly, "but the people are not through shouting yet.
There has been a great excitement in town these last few
days."</p>

<p>"And I knew nothing of it!" exclaimed Imogene.
Suddenly she looked at Helen. "How did you hear
about what took place in the court-room to-day?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Mr. Byrd told me."</p>

<p>"Ah, Mr. Byrd?"</p>

<p>"He came to leave a good-bye for you. He goes
home this afternoon."</p>

<p>"I should like to have seen Mr. Byrd," said Imogene.</p>

<p>"Would you?" queried the little lady, quietly shaking
her head. "I don't know; I think it is just as well you
did not see him," said she.</p>

<p>But she made no such demur when a little while later
Mr. Gryce was announced. The fatherly old gentleman
had evidently been in that house before, and Mrs. Richmond
was not the woman to withstand a man like him.</p>

<p>He came immediately into the room where Imogene
was sitting. Evidently he thought as Helen did, that
good news never hurts.</p>

<p>"Well!" he cried, taking her trembling hand in his,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[604]</a></span>
with his most expressive smile. "What did I tell you?
Didn't I say that if you would only trust me all would
come right? And it has, don't you see? Right as a
trivet."</p>

<p>"Yes," she returned; "and I never can find words
with which to express my gratitude. You have saved
two lives, Mr. Gryce: his&mdash;and mine."</p>

<p>"Pooh! pooh!" cried the detective, good-humoredly.
"You mustn't think too much of any thing I have done.
It was the falling limb that did the business. If Mr.
Orcutt's conscience had not been awakened by the stroke
of death, I don't know where we should have been to-day.
Affairs were beginning to look pretty dark for
Mansell."</p>

<p>Imogene shuddered.</p>

<p>"But I haven't come here to call up unpleasant memories,"
he continued. "I have come to wish you joy and
a happy convalescence." And leaning toward her, he
said, with a complete change of voice: "You know, I
suppose, why Mr. Mansell presumed to think <i>you</i> guilty
of this crime?"</p>

<p>"No," she murmured, wearily; "unless it was because
the ring he believed me to have retained was found on
the scene of murder."</p>

<p>"Bah!" cried Mr. Gryce, "he had a much better
reason than that."</p>

<p>And with the air of one who wishes to clear up all misunderstandings,
he told her the words which her lover<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[605]</a></span>
had overheard Mrs. Clemmens say when he came up to
her dining-room door.</p>

<p>The effect on Imogene was very great. Hoping to
hide it, she turned away her face, showing in this struggle
with herself something of the strength of her old days.
Mr. Gryce watched her with interest.</p>

<p>"It is very strange," was her first remark. "I had
such reasons for thinking him guilty; he such good
cause for thinking me so. What wonder we doubted
each other. And yet I can never forgive myself for
doubting him; I can sooner forgive him for doubting
me. If you see him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If <i>I</i> see him?" interrupted the detective, with a
smile.</p>

<p>"Yes," said she. "If you see him tell him that Imogene
Dare thanks him for his noble conduct toward one
he believed to be stained by so despicable a crime, and
assure him that I think he was much more justified in his
suspicions than I was in mine, for there were weaknesses
in my character which he had ample opportunities for
observing, while all that I knew of him was to his credit."</p>

<p>"Miss Dare," suggested the detective, "couldn't you
tell him this much better yourself?"</p>

<p>"I shall not have the opportunity," she said.</p>

<p>"And why?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mansell and I have met for the last time. A
woman who has stained herself by such declarations as
I made use of in court the last time I was called to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[606]</a></span>
stand has created a barrier between herself and all earthly
friendship. Even he for whom I perjured myself so
basely cannot overleap the gulf I dug between us two
that day."</p>

<p>"But that is hard," said Mr. Gryce.</p>

<p>"My life <i>is</i> hard," she answered.</p>

<p>The wise old man, who had seen so much of life and
who knew the human heart so well, smiled, but did not
reply. He turned instead to another subject.</p>

<p>"Well," he declared, "the great case is over! Sibley,
satisfied with having made its mark in the world, will now
rest in peace. I quit the place with some reluctance myself.
'Tis a mighty pretty spot to do business in."</p>

<p>"You are going?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Immediately," was the reply. "We detectives don't
have much time to rest." Then, as he saw how deep a
shadow lay upon her brow, added, confidentially: "Miss
Dare, we all have occasions for great regret. Look at
me now. Honest as I hold myself to be, I cannot blind
myself to the fact that I am the possible instigator of this
crime. If I had not shown Mr. Orcutt how a man like
himself might perpetrate a murder without rousing suspicion,
he might never have summoned up courage to
attempt it. For a detective with a conscience, that is a
hard thought to bear."</p>

<p>"But you were ignorant of what you were doing," she
protested. "You had no idea there was any one present
who was meditating crime."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[607]</a></span></p>

<p>"True; but a detective shouldn't be ignorant. He
ought to know men; he has opportunity enough to learn
them. But I won't be caught again. Never in any company,
not if it is composed of the highest dignitaries in
the land, will I ever tell again how a crime of any
kind can be perpetrated without risk. One always runs
the chance of encountering an Orcutt."</p>

<p>Imogene turned pale. "Do not speak of him," she
cried. "I want to forget that such a man ever lived."</p>

<p>Mr. Gryce smiled again.</p>

<p>"It is the best thing you can do," said he. "Begin a
new life, my child; begin a new life."</p>

<p>And with this fatherly advice, he said good-bye, and she
saw his wise, kind face no more.</p>

<p>The hour that followed was a dreary one for Imogene.
Her joy at knowing Craik Mansell was released could not
blind her to the realization of her own ruined life.
Indeed she seemed to feel it now as never before; and as
the slow minutes passed, and she saw in fancy the strong
figure of Mansell surrounded by congratulating admirers
and friends, the full loneliness of her position swept over
her, and she knew not whether to be thankful or not to
the fever for having spared her blighted and dishonored
life.</p>

<p>Mrs. Richmond, seeing her so absorbed, made no
attempt at consolation. She only listened, and when a
step was heard, arose and went out, leaving the door
open behind her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[608]</a></span></p>

<p>And Imogene mused on, sinking deeper and deeper
into melancholy, till the tears, which for so long a time had
been dried at their source, welled up to her eyes and fell
slowly down her cheeks. Their touch seemed to rouse
her. Starting erect, she looked quickly around as if to
see if anybody was observing her. But the room seems
quite empty, and she is about to sink back again with a
sigh when her eyes fall on the door-way and she becomes
transfixed. A sturdy form is standing there! A manly,
eager form in whose beaming eyes and tender smile shine
a love and a purpose which open out before her quite a
different future from that which her fancy had been so
ruthlessly picturing.</p>

<h2>BAYARD TAYLOR'S NOVELS.</h2>

<div class='hang1'>
I. <b>Hannah Thurston.</b> <span class="smcap">A Story of American Life</span> 12mo. Household edition,        $1.50<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"If Bayard Taylor has not placed himself, as we are half inclined to suspect,
in the front rank of novelists, he has produced a very remarkable book&mdash;a
really original story, admirably told, crowded with life-like characters
full of delicate and subtle sympathies, with ideas the most opposite to his
own, and lighted up throughout with that playful humor which suggests always
wisdom rather than mere fun."&mdash;<i>London Spectator.</i></p></div>

<div class='hang1'>
II. <b>John Godfrey's Fortunes.</b> <span class="smcap">Related by Himself</span> 12mo. Household edition,           $1.50<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"'John Godfrey's Fortunes,' without being melodramatic or morbid, is
one of the most fascinating novels which we have ever read. Its portraiture
of American social life, though not flattering, is eminently truthful; its delineation
of character is delicate and natural; its English, though sometimes
careless, is singularly grateful and pleasant."&mdash;<i>Cleveland Leader.</i></p></div>

great rest after the crowded artistic effects and the conventional interests of
even the better kind of English novels."&mdash;<i>London Spectator.</i></p>

<p>"As a picture of rural life, we think this novel of Mr. Taylor's excels any
of his previous productions."&mdash;<i>N. Y. Evening Post.</i></p>
